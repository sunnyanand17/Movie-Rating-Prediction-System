Initially, early film-makers years ago realized that when shooting with those amounts of frames, the viewers brain would piece together the missing parts (frames or motions). In addition, the film-makers could save money on film by using less frames than say, 30 or 48 etc. So 23.97 FPS became the holy grail. 

Also, let's no confuse Hz with FPS. It's true that the refresh rate (Hz) is the numerical limit for the number of frames displayed at a given second. So 60Hz means the TV or monitor refreshes its display 60 times per second. So a max of 60 frames per second is possible. Any more, and the display won't be able to show you them. 

Sports and news etc are typically captured in 30fps to give a more life like appearance on set and to minimize blurring in sports while movies traditionally maintain 23.97 or basically 24 which is why they appear slightly different. 

What you're seeing in the Hobbit, is the actors appear so lifelike, that it looks like you're watching a play. This is because you're brain isn't forced to fill in the blanks. It's seeing more of the motion of objects like in real life. Thus, the movies appear play-like and different. The CG however, while appearing more life-like as well, benefits more because you're mind accepts it more easily and your suspension of disbelief is more efficient. This is the same with video-games. They appear smoother and less fake. 

OP, you just need to get used to the clarity. Your mind is used to working overtime during movies and games and it's now needing sitting there going ""Wait, what's going on? Where's my homework?"" Eventually, it will pass and you will end up watching something at 24 fps and think ""Man this is choppy.""

First of all, none of the parents are changing their child's sex, they are allowing the kids to present with the 'gender' that that they feel comfortable with and giving hormone blockers to the older kids in order to delay delay puberty. 

This course of action isn't as superficial as a preference for girls clothing (pink/blue), 'gender dysphoria' is deeper than that it also  involves strong and persistent feelings of unhappiness with their assigned gender, disgust with their own genitalia, general preoccupation with their appearance, inability to play with other children, low mood etc. It takes a great deal of therapy and psychological assessment to endorse this type of intervention.

&gt;There's no need to give them something to worry about needlessly at such a young age.

...And this is the point, you would only take this path if it was going to improve your child's quality of life. The child would have to be unhappy and ""worried"" to begin with.

I just saw the movie last night, so now there are two of us. I could see why people would be more forgiving with Nathan--he's got ""great man of history"" narratives to justify what he's doing, and since Silicon Valley is the ""teflon industry,"" people love a tech ""disruptor"" running roughshod over existing notions of propriety.

The film also takes the time to emphasize Nathan's monomania with his misquoting Caleb at the beginning. He revealingly rewrites his own legend to propagate his own Promethean self-conception, a clear indicator that he's operating in a different, malevolent register. And as you say, AI may be artificial, but do the degree it thinks anything, it doesn't want to be confined and scheduled for destruction. It's clear from the (very disturbing!) sequence of the robot grinding its arms to pieces pounding the door that these AIs are experiencing cruelty. The fact that they're not human (as we conceive humanity) doesn't change the fact that he's subjecting a consciousness to sensations it hates. Animal's aren't human, either, but they want to be free and experience pain, and many believe that they should be treated humanely despite their genetic differences.

I think you hit the nail on the head about the gender issues, too. In fact, I think that's a huge part of the narrative which is under-discussed. I think a lot about how one views Nathan depends on how they view the act of creating a slew of semi-sentient realdoll servants which are occasionally verbally abused. And the fact is that Nathan gives Ava one chance at life/freedom, and it's dependent on her seduction abilities, is tremendously consequential.",,0,0,t1_cqpugwt,

When the system arrives at a conclusion, you write rules to do the ""sanity check"" we're discussing...to check the goal state...and so on. (I assume we agree that the concept of rules is not enough.)  
This is informally what I mean by morality/ethics. It needs to be part of the goal state description AND the generator rules.  *I don't (would never) assert that 3 rules (or thousands) are sufficient for proper conduct* ...only that you need a formal definition of ""proper"", whether its insurance or critical systems (I've built both types).  
An industrial robot with a high mass arm is a critical system. So is an anthropomorphic automaton. Either can kill you in a heartbeat. You need rules and formal definitions about that.  
How many are enough? What characteristics are necessary and sufficient...especially in the wild? I don't know. Ava had an insufficient set...at the risk of understatement.

On IMAX because your crystals are dealing with a smaller part of the image, you'll have lots more red and green crystals, but the number of red-green mush crystals won't have increased in proportion, so your colour is more accurate. 

Now say your red part of the pattern consists of fine dots of various shades of red - well obviously the finer detail of IMAX will render more of those shades than 35mm can.

If the villain in Thor was half of any other we could have some build up that they tried in the Avengers 2 and was cut from the theater. 

It is funny because it took me a while to realize that except for cap 2, all the other main characters got a bigger development here instead of their own movies. Notice that cap even takes a back seat on this movie in those terms.

Each movie feels more like an event, no wonder people like Loki so much, he is not an episodic antagonist. And I guess this is my biggest problem with Ultron, the trailers build up a more menancing character, the movie displays something a bit more logical since he is just out in the world and he is still learning just like Vision.

Fair enough then. I guess you aren't a Hulk fan because that is why Stan Lee created the character. To explore the psyche of a scientists who by all accounts should be a successful and happy and be in control of his emotions but is still unable to control them and the ugly side of himself.

It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father. 

I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions. 

He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived. 

You are wrong many people like the Hulk especially film enthusiasts. I understand if you just like straight forward comic films, Hulk was just different. ",,0,0,t1_cqtr9r8,

Mostly because I think it may answer my question. 

&gt;using it as an excuse to sexually harass you, pulling pranks on you related to it, or just bringing it up whenever the fancy strikes them. In a perfect world and in a perfect society, nobody would give a fuck. We don't live in either of those

Which, what you're basically suggesting here is that, because the majority of people are heteronormative, that most of the people that join the armed forces are therefore heteronormative, so to keep people in line the armed forces has decided to draw a codified set of rules around heteronormaitivity and enforce them?

Also, I have to point out, that if it wasn't against the rules it wouldn't be good leverage for blackmail.

Even as a kid I knew the T-1000 had killed that cop. ""Punching"" him in the gut, with a ""punch"" that ends in a crunch sound, doesn't usually mean good things. And no one thought the gut punch was a KO.

They used to do that kind of thing *all the time* in movies. It's done a few times in T2. VFX shots are a pain-in-the-ass for the production crew, and even more so in 1991, so they were used sparingly, to the point where for one shot the T-1000 was portrayed by a guy in a silver mylar suit. The cop/security guard killed by the T-1000 at the insane asylum was played by identical twins, just so they didn't have to do split-screen/blue-screen work. Plus, less is more, and the T-1000's introductory scene lets you know he's a bad guy without having to spell it out.

The ominous Terminator music that starts playing when John Connor sees Arnold in the Mall shootout is more to reveal John Connor's own internal thought process: *Oh shit my crazy mom wasn't crazy!* and then *Oh shit this dude is here to kill me!* But we, the audience, know that he's the Good Terminator and he's here to help.",,0,0,t1_cqu51tn,

It focuses a lot on how things change between Frank &amp; Claire which in some cases is a strength and in others is a weakness.

The tesseract is the space gem which is why it teleported Red Skull into space and Thor and Loki back to Asgard after The Avengers. The orb in Guardians of the Galaxy is the power gem which is why it just blows people up. The Ether in dark world is the reality gem which is why they were going to use it to change reality into dark matter or... something. And the gem in the scepter is the mind gem which is why Loki could mind control people with it. Kinda weird that Thanos was willing to hand it over to Loki though.

**1977**, I'd take *Annie Hall* even though it would be close. I wouldn't really have a problem with it going to *Star Wars* either. Both are great movies.

Since the first Oscars covered **1927** and **1928**, *The Circus*, *Steamboat Bill Jr.*, *Sunrise*, and *The Passion of Joan of Arc* would be in contention with *Metropolis*. I'd probably go with *The Circus*, but any would be a fine choice.

**1991** is tough. *The Double Life of Veronique* and *A Brighter Summer Day* are the two clear choices imo. *Raise the Red Lantern*, *Barton Fink*, and *Beauty and the Beast* are all worth noting too. I'd put *Terminator 2* behind all of them.

**1968**, I'd go with *Once Upon a Time in the West*, followed by *2001*. *Salesman* and *The Lion in Winter* are also worth noting. I haven't seen *Rosemary's Baby*, which seems to be a favorite from that year as well, so I can't comment on that. 2001 would be a very good choice though.

**2006**, I really like *Still Life*, *The Lives of Others*, and *Pan's Labyrinth* over *Children of Men*. *Letters from Iwo Jima*, *The Departed*, and *Little Miss Sunshine* as well probably.

**1979** is a dead heat. *Apocalypse Now*, *Manhattan*, *Alien*, and *Stalker* would all be my choices for top film of the year. I'd go with *Apocalypse Now*, but *Alien* would be a fine choice too. *Kramer vs. Kramer* looks pretty insubstantial compared to any of them.",,1430471091,0,t1_cqu8uyt,

You're not special to anybody but your loving family when you're just a kid -- you're just that, another kid -- unless you *do* something that demonstrates that you *are* special -- as the Doctor points out later in KtM, when he moderates his initial reaction by pointing out that becoming the first woman on the moon when she grows up will put her firmly and legitimately into the category of ""special"".

Don't confuse Whedon's writing with the overall tone of the MCU. My argument is two-fold: Whedon's quip-based writing I find distasteful after seeing it presented over and over again in his works, and that style wouldn't fit in the current DC film universe. 

It works with Marvel's films because they specifically (as you said) designed the characters in the universe that way. But character personality continuity is not grounds to say ""well that's OK then because they've always been this way"". Poor writing is poor writing.

&gt;If he did Flash or Nightwing or whoever, I'm pretty sure he'd use that character's levity to undermine the serious nature of Batman like any writer/director would as has worked to great effect in the comics.

Comics and films are different mediums and require different techniques to properly convey the art. Due to the extremely dark nature of MoS, and BvS, any Whedon intervention would feel completely out of place. I have a feeling DC, when they get to Flash (and in the distant future, Nightwing), are going to tweak the characters to fit the universe better. 

Nothing would feel more out of place than a subject about false Gods and the morality of having a super being on earth in BvS, followed by Flash stepping in and going ""DUDE, SHWARMA, LMAO"" like in the Avengers. That won't happen in the current style of DC films.",,0,0,t1_cqu9dzt,

In that regard, T3 changes the hell out of the future from the first scene, so it's funny how people act like it tells us the future can't be changed just because a completely unreliable narrator tells us so. Considering the only reason Sky Net was activated was because Sky Net went back in time and uploaded itself into our network, considering a half dozen Generals are murdered and will therefore not become Generals in the future to become targets Sky Net will send a T-X back in time to murder...we have to deal with the fact that time in the Terminator universe has always been malleable and alterable.

And then, the screenplay goes through many rewrites, with notes from a succession of clueless studio execs, who just mess it up further.

That often leads to a bland, confusing mess of a movie, which still makes back its budget (though the studio still finds ways of reporting it as a loss through creative accounting) on the strength of a couple of its stars, and a few marketable lines that get repeated over and over in the trailers and TV commercials.

The only times big budgets lead to good movies is when there's someone at the helm who has a cohesive vision, and the power to say no to all the ""notes"" from execs that would go against that vision.  Usually, that means an established director who has had enough success to be able to finance a large part of the movie (or whose name has enough clout to pull in the money without too many strings attached to it.)

For something like Ouija (which I haven't seen, so I'm just talking in general) it looks like an obvious cash-in, on something somewhat controversial (at least in the Bible Belt) so I'm surprised any studio considered a big budget for that.

Like people look back on it as the okay one but that's just because it was the least hurtful and in the end it was mostly just because your expectations were so low at that point it didn't matter. I mean the entire movie is basically pointless until the obiwan anakin fight because the only fucking plot is anakin becoming a bad guy. Why do they have that weird long intro with the robot lizard guy and his weird droids. 

Wait why can't the Jedi love? If they could then none of this would have happened. How does love lead to the dark side? That's not how emotions work. How come Anakin kills a bunch of kids for no reason? He just becomes evil because he needs to and then he murders children.

Yes, I remember that, but organic does not mean 'human aging', it just means alive. Surely if these futuristic humans can create T1000 liquid human robots and time travelers, they probably had no problem creating skin that does not suffer aging defects at the rate Arnold himself is aging lol :P

There's plenty of examples of living creatures that have the ability to renew themselves (see [Turritopsis dohrnii] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii), and I have no doubt skynet or similar science in the future figured that one out.

But he always comes back around, comes back down to earth. 

Generally he can become arrogant and dismissive (petulant comes to mind) of his fans...but it's temporary. I think most long-term fans know what's up and just dismiss these kerfluffles after they spring up. 

I cannot imagine how tiring fandom is for the creative side, then you add the suits via corporate on these types of projects.  The pressure must be insane. But they sign on for this, and at this point, he should know his limit. It will all work itself out as it usually does. 

Honestly, I'm more dismayed at the Renner / Evans stupidity regarding their comments on Black Widow. Seems like a rough junket for everyone this time round. ",,0,0,t1_cqub8dc,

In T1 Kyle gets sent back in time to protect Sarah, so she can bear John Connor, who is the leader of the resistance...important stuff. At the end of the movie, the two fall in love. Kyle Reese is actually the father of John Connor. Yay for time shenanigans...So You send back your soldier to protect your mother in the past, but that soldier is actually your father...weeeeeeeeird, but cool ^^  
  
In T2 the Terminator from the 1st movie is sent back in time to protect Sarah and John from another Terminator (the liquid one). The original Terminator (arnie) dies at the end.  
  
In T3 Arnie gets sent back again to protect a more or less adult John Connor from the Terminatrix. The movie ends with Skynet destroying life on Earth, because you know, Judgment Day can't be stopped, blabla...

In T4 we actually get to know a bit more about Terminators and sending them back in time, kinda.  
  
In the new movie Kyle Reese gets sent back in time to deal with the Terminator, who got sent back in time to kill Sarah. However, the timeline for some inexplicable reason is already altered, and that Terminator has already been terminated...by its T2 version (the good Arnie killed the bad Arnie). In the trailer you can also see the liquid metal Terminator. So this time a younger Sarah Connor fights the T1000 together with the good T800 (arnie) and Kyle Reese...

Since I guess we are talking about low-budget field/location recording there's a lot of stuff just not worth worrying about because no normal person will care/notice at that level beyond a certain point. This is known as the ""law of diminishing returns"".

IIRC the H4N can supply 48v Phantom ""P48"" power on XLR so that's a good start. You can jack in pretty much any mic except T-power (but T-power are ancient, still sound good-to-great, you might run into them on eBay - but they are generally heavier than modern stuff and not worth the bother except for collectors and nostalgists).

First thing to consider is the application and how the polar pick-up pattern of the mic will affect that application. The basic choices are omni, cardioid, hypercardioid/supercardioid/lobar.

Interview mics and lavs tend to be omni - no off-axis noise rejection. They are held real close to the subject so it's not generally an issue.

Cardioid pattern mics are generally best used indoors in controlled audio conditions on practical sets (ie real world locations). Cardioids reduce pick-up of sound from behind the capsule, and have a wide spread of capture in front.

The rest generally get termed 'shotguns' (although the modern Schoeps and Sennheiser line don't have inches long interference tubes anymore). These have a much narrower pick-up pattern and you really need the subject to be on-mic or things will start sounding pretty bad pretty quick. They are great in noisy places or in the hands of adept boom-ops on a sound stage or anywhere else.

Personally I'd suggest a cardioid is a great all-rounder with the caveat that in noisy conditions you'll need to get it closer to your subject. But all microphones benefit from good placement anyway. Shotgun mics are no silver bullet, certainly not without a proficient boom-op or careful consideration about why you are using it. But even the best boom-op isn't a miracle worker.

Frequency response is also worth looking at - many proclaim 20Hz - 20kHz (the general range of human hearing) but they all roll-off or peak or trough or are otherwise not 'flat' in their response - if you don't see the frequency response published without a graph it's pretty meaningless. and anyhow it's not uncommon to engage a 80Hz rolloff anyway to eliminate rumble and stuff. But it is a roll-off - not a cliff so things still sound 'natural'.

Anyway, if a mic doesn't publish specs it generally means that manufacturer doesn't want you to know them for some reason. Those are best avoided.

Max SPL - Sound Pressure Level - is also worth considering. I'd look for a bare minimum of around 110dB but ideally 130dB and above is what you want (and pay for).

I could blather about this all day and still not be able to make a recommendation because microphone choice gets really really subjective. If you have a dealer or a music shop near you it's difficult to beat going in and having a listen. Take your H4N and ask to do test recording.

Stay away from being tempted by ultra-cheap and look at your mic as an investment for the next decade and beyond. I still use the mic I bought in 2004 as my go-to mic.

The lead actor was 16 when the film was made (from what I know) and by the end of it you see him age 30 years. The film was shot chronologically, so you see him slowly deteriorate scene after scene. At the end, you are just as exhausted and distraught as he is. The film is a journey that you go along with, and you're the passenger in this boy's nightmare. Shooting the film was so stressful that the actor was pulling his hair out towards the end of production. After it wrapped and he went back to school, his hair was white from all the stress.

Also, live ammunition was used in the movie. There are moments where live rounds are whizzing just inches past the boy's head, all for the sake of completing a scene for a sense of realism. But it worked - the film was noted as being so realistic that soldiers who lived the real days commended Elem Klimov. Here's a quote from wiki said by a German soldier after one of its screenings: *""I was a soldier of the Wehrmacht; moreover, an officer of the Wehrmacht. I traveled through all of Poland and Belarus, finally reaching Ukraine. I will testify: everything that is told in this film is the truth. And the most frightening and shameful thing for me is that this film will be seen by my children and grandchildren.""*

It really is a film that should be viewed just once in a lifetime. You discover the true nature of the human being and what it's capable of. You learn more about yourself and the reason behind why these films are made. For being Elem Klimov's final film, he went out with an absolute bang and finished his legacy with one of the most devastating films of all time.",,1430494689,0,t1_cquel26,

Indies are loose and fast but don't make much, blockbusters are slow and tedious but can typically make back the budget.  Indie's only hopes for going wide come from the A-lister marketing the shit out of some dinky half finished basement film at sundance so a studio might pick up the distribution rights.

Working on Indies, no matter the role is typically difficult at best; micro budgets, self proclaimed experts, faulty gear or no gear, questionable insurance if any, lack of any legal knowledge, usually just a skeleton crew most just out of college or amateur level.  Big budget pictures offer their own hassels more along the lines of hollywood politics, large egos and large scale coordination (Film crews can be the size of small armies for blockbusters these days, not to mention VFX in post later on).  These are just some experiences that come to mind at 2am though.  Many many more, both pros and cons to both sides.  But Robert hit the nail on the head here.

There is just something about driving to the theater and getting my popcorn and slushie and settling in to watch the previews of what I can look forward to with a group of friends. There is just something about the magic of movies. Ouija wasn't great. But it was a first date with a friend that loves scary movies. It was stereotypical, but it was cheap, fun escapism and for two hours I could put aside school and just lose myself in the screen and the people with me. I'm not an art or film critic, just a business major. So while there are movies that are amazing, the ones that are ok, are just that to me, ok. I don't get offended by movies being bad, I just enjoy the time. A man once told me that the journey is the destination and its sounds kind of groovy and out there. But I can apply that to movies.

&gt; **Before the interview began, Robert Downey Jr? assistant had spent two hours fretting about getting the temperature in the room just right.** He needn? have worried. For as the Hollywood star joined Lorraine Kelly in a hotel suite for a chat, **there was just one thing on his mind.
Miss Kelly has revealed that as the 49-year-old actor sat down, he blurted out: ?ice t*ts.?*

&gt;The ITV breakfast host, 54, who has a 36C bust, said: ?obert was not quite himself. He had a time in his life when maybe he was discovering himself, having issues. He came on looking a bit worse for wear and he had no shoes on and he wandered around and he sat down and I said hello and he looked at me and said, ?ice t*ts? It could have been worse. He could have said, ?h, I don? like them? It is a difficult thing to respond to.?
&gt;Downey Jr? comments were all the more surprising because Miss Kelly had been primed to think his first concern would be how hot it was. Speaking on tomorrow night? Jonathan Ross Show on ITV, she said: ?e were in a hotel room waiting for him and a minion came in and said the room was too hot. He kept coming back every ten minutes saying ?he room is too hot. Robert won? like it??he man had a Robert Downey Jr thermometer. Anyway, Robert came and he was fine. He didn? know what they were talking about.?

From Wiki:  
In 2029, John Connor, leader of the Resistance, continues the war against the machines. At the Los Angeles offensive, John's fears of the unknown future begin to emerge when John is notified by his army unit, Tech-Com, that Skynet will attack him from two fronts, past and future, and will ultimately change warfare forever.

On the verge of winning the war against Skynet, Connor sends his trusted lieutenant Kyle Reese back through time to save his mother's life and ensure his own existence. However, Kyle finds the original past changed. In this timeline, a Terminator was sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor as a child and so the Resistance sent their own cyborg back in time to protect her. After the assassin killed her parents, the reprogrammed T-800 raised and trained her to face her destiny which she adamantly tries to reject.

Now, faced with a new mission, Kyle, Sarah and the old ally Terminator, have to escape the T-800 and the recent T-1000 sent by Skynet to kill them, as well as a new and horrific enemy: Kyle and Sarah's own future son, who has been converted into a nanotechnological human-cyborg hybrid. With John Connor finally compromised by Skynet, they must find a way to stop Judgment Day from ever happening; [4] while at the same time trying to stop the sinister GENISYS app from going online.",,0,0,t1_cqugidm,

Just because it wasn't as bad as the first two, doesn't mean it was good.

The special effects are ridiculously bad for a movie barely ten years old, the acting is terrible, the plot is slow, the fight scenes jumpy and dragged out, with characters deemed 'unimportant' shoved to the sides for new ridiculous, asthma breathing robots. 

Seriously. Watch it again. Watch it again without watching numbers one and two first. Your eyes, ears and nose will bleed.

Some of the non-canon comics and such have done some great sci-fi in the Terminator universe, when they're not just paying for a license to throw Superman and Xenomorphs into the mix.

Personally, I like the idea of a Terminator that was meant to be sent back to 1901 to really rig the timelines in Skynet's favour - possibly without a very good plan, since Skynet seems to have gone crazy over all these looping tangled years of somehow failing to kill squishy flesh-things that die if they get a bit too warm or cold - but which accidentally got sent back much, *much* [further](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/reference). And has been learning ever since. And doesn't know which side it's on, these days.

That Terminator should be played by someone who does not have huge muscles, and can actually act. (One of the silliest things about Terminators through the decades is that their ""infiltrators"" keep looking like Mister Universe, or runway models. An infiltrator should look like an ordinary schlub. Which kind of was the [original](http://imgur.com/BxDqh0b) [idea](https://twitter.com/dansdata/status/590349392328044544).)

5. Sarah raises this new John Connor, still with half the DNA as the original, this one get's raised being told he's humanity's savior and that Kyle is his dad. He becomes a good leader.

I don't really have the time to watch the full show every week, three hours is a lot.

You might want to check out Lucha Underground. It treats wrestling like a TV show instead of a pseudo-sport. More focus on coherent storylines and character development. There is a lot of great wrestling too, enhanced with elaborate camera angles and lighting like you would see in a drama. Each episode is an hour long and is filled with amazing material.

The Pacific, is a bit slower paced, and is very traumatic, at least in my viewing of it. The Island hopping of the Pacific Theater were just like Multiple D-Day landings. The portrayal of the fighting with the Japanese soldiers was very different than the battles with Germany portrayed in Band of Brothers. The Japanese didn't surrender, and they don't shy away from the brutality of the battles on the islands. Whereas with Band of Brothers you enjoy the characters and connect with them.

You must have glanced over the part where I said that any porn or overt sexuality is frowned upon - regardless if it's ""heteronormative"" or not.  They don't care if you're gay, straight, an alien, bigfoot, a robot, or anything else and you're having sex with an elephant, a sock, bigfoot, or another man/woman.  If you're taking sexually explicit photos/videos in any form and they get out in the wild (intentionally or unintentionally), then you're in trouble for the reasons that I stated.  

You're also incorrect.  It's against the rules *because* it is good leverage for blackmail.  Because we still live in a society where doing anything overtly sexual is taboo.  And also, you know... the part where he's **married and didn't think to tell his wife that he was posing as a gay male on cam for money**.  Why?  Hmmm, probably because he didn't think she'd agree with it.  Sounds like ripe blackmail material to me.  ""Tell us what we want to know or we show your wife this video we copied from one of your gay camshows.""  Seeing as how it'd be a rather large embarrassment if it ever got out that his wife divorced him because he was posing as a gay camwhore for money, I'm sure he'd rather not be made fun of by literally everyone that he knows.  That's what you do in the military, make jokes and give everyone shit because it's the best way to let off steam after a stressful day that doesn't involve injuring someone.

You say that like it's an automatic and totally doable. It is not. Money doesn't fall from the sky every time you get a curve ball while making a film.

But if you're considering that 8mm is typically screened a few feet wide, and 35mm is projected on your average theater screen, and IMAX screens are proportionally larger again, one could say that the difference is non-existent.

Edit: It's like comparing both pixel resolution and chroma sampling for digital. It makes a difference if the size of the projected pixel grid (here: grain) changes. If not, it's the same.

So for example, it is Day 1 of shooting. And you are shooting Scene 9 that has 3 camera setups/shots. The first shot will be slated as ""Scene 9, Slate 1, Take 1"". Increment the take numbers until you finish that shot. Next shot will be called ""Scene 9, Slate 2, Take 1"". Then the next shot will be called ""Scene 9, Slate 3, Take 1"". And so on.

Then after you finish shooting that scene, say you start shooting Scene 5. You'll continue the Slate Number where you last left off. So, your next slate will be ""Scene 5, Slate 4, Take 1"". And so on. This slate number will never reset or repeat.

Now, people can reference a shot later by just saying the Slate Number and Take Number. The Scene number on the slate is optional in the European system if you have a Script Supervisor. They should take notes to correlate the Scene and Slate Number. But it is a good idea to put the Scene on the slate anyways for quicker and easier reference.

This battle is a classic example of using fight choreography to tell a story.

At the upfront, Vader underestimates Luke. He's fighting him one handed because he doesn't think Luke is a worthy opponent. But Luke holds his own. He escapes from the freezing chamber and manages to throw Vader off guard with the smoke/steam/freezing gas. When he recovers, he starts using both hands on the saber. But still, Luke holds his own and pushes Vader off of the platform. 

When they meet up again, Vader grabs his saber with both hands and uses the force to give him the upper hand. 

Luke climbs back up and Vader ambushes him. At this point, Vader's not going easy on Luke anymore. But then Luke hits him. Luke lands a blow on Vader's shoulder. It's only after Luke gets this touch that Vader gives him everything he's got and chops off Luke's hand. 

Vader stepped up his game because he needed to. Luke was way better than he was expecting. ",,0,0,t1_cqukov6,

I can take a million fight scenes from movies and show you how they don't actually swing at an opponents face every single time, the idea is that it looks plausible when watching the movie. Action sequences do not have to look perfect when held up to slow motion scrutiny, that's absurd. 

In anticipation of ""I noticed the first time I saw it!"" hey, can't argue with that statement, I can just tell you that before I noticed people analyzing the shit out of an action sequence because they have a hard on for hating these movies (which is fine, they suck in a lot of ways), these sequences always looked great. We do not need a typical sword fight, lightsabers are one of the most unique and cool weapons in science fiction history, having the fights look like they're being fought by absolute lightening quick professionals who know their craft is great.

I more expected Ultron to target his beautiful, **untouchable**, **unharmable** family. Set fire to the farm, or something. I think the real goal out of Boring and Natasha was to set up a movie for them. Give you insight into who they were and make them more likable. Because Black Widow is the most useless, needlessly cryptic character in the franchise and Hawkeye was given the shaft with his cameo in Thor and his 1/3 of not-secondary-character part of Avengers 1. So with the Avengers initiative reinstated, and all of the interesting guys going on vacation, we get a movie with Marvel's scraps. It'll only serve to tie into how they manage to drag Tony back and find Bruce.

Honestly, I didn't care much for the movie. It dug itself a hole. It essentially made the characters unlikable and aimed too big. The whole ""what defines evil?"" angle of the villain and his desire to just want to make the world work was driven way too far. The pseudo-philosophical debates between characters got old, and it really only served to give a sense that taking this anywhere else will just seem dull and overused. Because what could the next villain possibly hope to achieve? World domination? Ultron was going to blow the shit up. Maybe annihilation of the one true threat to him, sort of like Loki. Repetition works in comics, but too much work goes into movies to do the same old schtick with a different coat of paint. They went too big too soon.

Killing off a potential main character was stupid. All to show that things aren't safe in the Marvel universe. ""We introduced this character and make you sympathize and OH LOOK, WE KILLED HIM! LOOK OUT IRON MAN AND HULK, YOU MIGHT BE NEXT OOOOH!"" Those characters were cool, and not used to their full potential. Quicksilver's scenes were ripped off from the same character's big break in DoFP, with slight deviation like him grabbing Thor's hammer in passing (they seriously need to quit using that gag, we get it, Thor's hammer can't be held by just anyone). I saw Clint stopping Scarlet Witch and making a reference to Loki's mind control coming a mile away. And that they didn't capitalize on her ability to control Hulk to use him advantageously  in the last battle was a gross oversight.

Then the plot holes. How is Tony's suit and the ""Veronica"" protocol still functioning if Jarvis is down? The suit stopped functioning with Jarvis's powering down in Iron Man 3. If Quicksilver kills bullet-deflecting machines by speed-punching through them, why did his sideswiping of Clint in the beginning not at least shatter a few bones? Why is Hulk's rage so fickle? He loses control in the first movie and nearly kills everyone on the ship, then proves he can control it later on. Then the movie opens with him controlling it and apologizing for changing.

* The trailers made it seem like he was this evil unforgiving force. Instead we got another Marvel villian with cheesy humour.

* His lips were damn unnerving

* His actions didn't seem to have much consequence. Really he never felt like a big danger.

* His intentions for wanting to destroy the world were hardly given much time. Ultron has an awesome backstory and his reasoning for wanting to bring extinction to humans is rather smart. Instead we just got this cliche villian who just wanted to destroy the world.

Hopefully the extended dvd builds on the story though and his character as I feel this movie was rather lacking.

&gt; The First Fiction Film Critical Of Scientology.

Haha, the movie starts with Miscarriage giving a speech on a video. ""You may have asked yourself: How are we really going to get Scientology tech into the hands of the 5.8 billion people on this planet?"" A similar interest is expressed on their Website, by the way, or was a few years ago when I read it.

Well, here's my suggestion: Use the Internet and give the people the information FOR FREE. Huh, why don't they do that? I guess because what they say there interest is is actually not really their interest. Easiest way to uncover this fact. It's almost blatant.

Uhh, thank you?  It was nice of you to clarify your insult for me?  

&gt;How come you are not commenting on my main point?

Well, I was gonna, but then you called me a failed film-maker and I found it so funny that I was like, meh, I'm just gonna let this one go.  Now you've gone out of your way to correctly insult me that I almost feel beholden to answering you.  Like, the balls of that.  I respect the balls. So here goes nothing:

You aren't taking the comment in the context of Downey's point of view.  From where we are, not in the business, it looks like Downey is being almost glib with an industry that has proven it can produce winners.

But where we see the successes--since, frankly what the fuck else are we ever going to see--Downey has seen THOUSANDS--literally *thousands*--of horseshit, incompetent, poorly run, poorly funded, poorly operated cluster-fucks.  AND, these complete shit-shows want a piece of his ass--BEG him in for dat ass--*every fucking day of his life*.  

And he's said yes to these things.  Probably worked on several in his time that went *nowhere*.  And now?  He's done.  He wants Iron Man.  He wants a schedule that is on schedule, a project that gets finished, a line out the door of top talent, and a guaranteed royalty check for the rest of his life.

And I totally get that.  I paralleled my point of view with Downey's because I have empathy with that point of view.  In fact, *I LIKE* the change of insult to, ""he failed miserably"", because fuck yeah I've had failures in my professional life.  In fact, they're some of the most valuable experiences I've ever had!  Kid, I'm telling you, if you still don't have a great ball of fire in your past than you aren't pushing your life hard enough.

The only thing I'd meh at is ""too frightened to try again"".  I mean, I get that you were going for punch, but I didn't really feel like I gave off the failed film-maker vibe.  But I digress.

In conclusion, no, indy movies aren't bad.  I LOVE INDY MOVIES (god damn you kids *really* misconstrued my statements here), but I'm talking from a perceptive of *business* and *age* and a lack of patience with the learning curve inherent to lower-tier budget productions.  And to feel ""disappointed"" at Downey's attitude is *extremely* naive, and *extremely* immature.  It's like, I was in the Marines, and I see young people wanting to go to war (they're out there), and I'm like, grow up.  You're being naive to the realities of the world.  Grow up. 

Oh, and on a *personal* level, I thought Iron Man 2 and 3 sucked, the Avengers bored the fuck out of me, and I loved Birdman.

I honestly thought they did a better job this time than with Loki and the Chitauri, maybe it's because the origin of Ultron was something internal, rather than external.

Exact same reasons you said; no stakes, no tension, way too much plot convenience, and contrived drama between characters. The dialogue felt formulated and the tone never really fit the scenes. Also the ending was ""oh there's a big alien army in a space wormhole, just toss a nuke up there!"" ""is Tony Stark dead? no of course not he's integral to the story!"" I could go on. 

But, this time around all of the things that I disliked about the first movie seemed to be fixed. The dialogue was fun, the avengers didn't have any unnecessary drama, the villain was not only tangible but interesting and on top of that it was downright hilarious. 

To be fair, I go into superhero movies expecting there to be little stakes, the idea that humans could (hawkeye, black widow) put themselves in those situations and not constantly be killed requires at least a bit of suspension of disbelief. And i agree that there's very little tension, I probably wouldn't have cared much if hawkeye died and as it was I didn't really care about quicksilver's character dying either.

Movies should be used to tell a single contained character story. Do Batman in The Long Halloween. Superman in all star. Take the stuff that perfectly captures everything the character is and make a movie out of that. But marvel's way of doing things is just putting the characters on the screen and doing a generic story arc. When you're reading a comic you know that the consequences don't matter. So writers gotta write some damn good characters. Some damn good dialogue. And some damn good story and interactions. And there wasn't really any of that in this movie. I guess it's kinda cause it's a team movie that we don't get these penultimate character portrayals.

I personally found it a little lack luster. The CGI was quite poor especially at the start, why have bad CGI in the opening it just ruins the immersion.

It was badly edited in places and some of the action scenes lacked any heart. If they weren't ripping apart flimsy robots or fake landing punches it just felt like a boring CGI gore-fest like Transformers.

Also the Nick Fury scene in the garage! If you can't get RDJ and SLJ in a room together to film a 3 minute scene maybe Joss/Marvel shouldn't attempt such a large ensemble cast.

It was also a little annoying how they just plodded from one thing to another. Ultron deletes all their files so they look at paper backups on Strucker. He apparently is connected to Klaue and despite there being no connection between Ultron-Strucker-Klaue our Herod decide to head on over to Africa and luckily just find him there.

The story just felt lazy to me tbh. Just a reimagining in Thor Dark World but slightly less shitty. Marvel really need to step up their game on villains because at tbis rate I'm probably not going to watch Ant Man in theatres if it's anything like AoU.",,0,0,t1_cqul8qm,

Hiddleston as Loki was cool and great on screen, but it never felt dangerous. The Chitauri were just wildly overmatched; for anyone on the team, it looked more like an aggressive workout than a desperate bid to save ~~the world~~ New York. I really enjoy the movie, but it's more about how fun it is to watch the characters than dramatic doubt: obviously they're going to punch flying aliens for a while, then find a way to stop the portal, confront Loki, and roll credits.

Here, though, the villain was their own fault, with a compelling reason to do what he does, not just, eh, I'm a villain, may as well try to kill everyone. His ability to regenerate, upgrade, and multiply makes him tough to take down, and his plan almost makes sense, kind of. 

Like, of course I knew the Avengers will win, he won't, but it felt like it might cost something, even besides the one character who has to die. It's the middle of a multi-part series, which traditionallymeans something darker, potentially with a down ending, so I was ready for bad things to happen, whereas in the first one you just know everything will be find when the CGI settles.",,0,0,t1_cqul8qm,

Although, they may well go with having characters retire instead of die to get around this, and even if they do die it might be possible to have the actor come back briefly to be revived and then retire.

I also suspect that, while Ultron was incredibly intelligent as a result of being able to access the entirety of the Internet, he was also immature as he hadn't truly experienced life, just downloaded it and assumed he was wise enough to lead humanity.

The first season was awesome. It was basically the story of Batman Begins but in a season-long form. They had a cohesive story and a refreshingly badass hero (he was a killing machine!). 

Now it's a typical CW/WB style show with romantic entanglements and no clear focus on plot. The characters are very inconsistent and only behave in a way that serves the current week's plot, and then they'll act completely differently the next week. There's clearly no longer any plotting or direction. It feels like the scripts are being assigned to random different writers every week, none of whom can agree on where the take the show.

They also killed off their best actress...

Whatever you were paid to write this comment it isn't enough.

EDIT: Just for fun, and to inform those that didn't know; ""Unfriended"" is a found-footage horror film (so let's subtract points for originalist/freshness right there because Blair Witch already did that more than a decade ago) which began life with the title ""Cybernatural"". Basically this movie is ""Paranormal Activity"" + ""Internet"" = ""Box Office Dollars"". I really hope it bombs because as a fan of the horror genre I'm getting very tired of lazily made found-footage horror films and this seems like one of *the most* lazily made in the entire genre. They scooped up sponsorship money from internet outfits like ChatRoulette so they could play mad-libs with the internet companies featured heavily in the movie.

The film doesn't really have much of an identity, because it's the first Marvel movie that is very clearly not designed to be a thing on its own (even more so than Iron Man 2). As a result, it doesn't have the charm of the first Avengers and plays it completely safe in comparison to Winter Soldier or even Iron Man 3. There's never any real tension when facing the present danger, and a whole lot of scene-setting for future films. I'm not surprised that Whedon is stepping back from the franchise, because there's a lot of this film that doesn't feel like him at all.

To put it another way, some of the best films ever made are part of wider narratives - Godfather 2, Empire, etc. But those are also really good movies in of themselves, not just connective tissue for a bigger story. Ultron is not going to be discussed in that rarefied company.

I wanted to see Cap get in Tony's face for real. Instead Stark just fucks up big time and it doesn't feel like anyone cares. 

Ultron when he first showed up was much scarier than when he showed up in his ""true form"", which sucks.

I was pumped that more women were gonna be in the movie, but it seems like as one new woman rises another must become a stereotype. Whedon, you're calling Jurassic World sexist and then you thrust Black Widow out of the role of sarcastic spy agent who has a purpose and right into love interest who can't have kids (which TOTALLY MATTERS FOR A WOMAN, her life is RUINED because she can't be a MOM :( booo boooo this throwaway plot point)  

Okay, I kinda wanna argue this point. I think that that only ever really came up because Hulk was like ""Dude, look, if I get excited, I turn into Hulk and tear you in half. I can't baby!"" And she was like ""Dude, it's fine. I can't either."" It wasn't so much that it ruins her life as much as like a ""It's okay, I can't have that, either. You don't have to have that if you're with me.""  

I honestly really liked her and Banner. I think that's a good mix. She's kinda become the Hulk Whisperer in this movie, and she's the one that can calm him down. And...I dunno, it's like a build up of 4 movies now with her that she's been this bad ass spy, and we're finally getting to see that one dimensional wall crack a bit, and we're seeing behind it all that she's a person with fears and dreams and wants and needs, too. I really liked this development with her, and maybe she's the balance that Banner needs to make him a more real person, too.  

I think that your annoyance at this plot point is actually a strength, and even if it was kinda tropey, it came up in an organic way in the story line. Two characters with a checkered past/kind of feel like monsters with no where to go in this world connect, and when they connect in a place where they see their friend/coworker has a normal life at the end of the day, they're like ""...shit, can we ever have this?"" It didn't feel like it was flung at us all at once, it felt like it was something that could really come up in a conversation with two people who are starting to get feelings for each other (which, btw, is also several movies of development on that, too. She was the person to go find him initially, and the first person who saw him hulk out, so, they've got history, kinda).  

I dunno, I just...it felt right to me, ya know?  

&gt; and is hurt and sent off twice and is fucking kidnapped and is more of a whimpering, emotional character than what she was set up as. I don't know if this was meant to be going into her character and giving her more, but it felt like giving her less by thrusting her into the classic action hero female tropes. It was disappointing.

Uuuuhh...okay. Fair point. She becomes the dumb damsel in distress and the dudebros gotta come rescue her. That's a fair point.  

...But she also leads them straight to Ultron's hidden base, too.  

...I honestly have no idea what the fuck Ultron actually wanted with her, specifically. Why did he kidnap her? Like, why specifically her? Did he just want to lure the Avengers there so he could Bond Villain all up in this bitch and be like ""Ha ha, can't stop me, assholes! Now die with your stupid civilians, cuz you're about to become the K6 Extinction Event, lol, kthxbye""  

I dunno. Which, brings me to your next point:  

&gt;Ultron. Ultron was all over the fucking place. One second he's a badass AI bent on world destruction, the next he's a whiny teenager. I get it. That's what he was. But it didn't work. It was scattershot, it was a HUGELY rushed character, and it was boring. Spader did a good job with the voice acting, but the character was too jumpy: going from quippy Stark clone to mega super villain to childish teen to silly murderer... blech. Such a waste. Thought Marvel finally had a good villain in their hands and then... nope.  

Yeah, I kinda agree. But...I don't think he's entirely *gone*, either.  

Ultron is like Hydra. You don't kill those guys off in the first movie. His brain is the internet. He could have easily made a back up of himself somewhere. He'll be back. Even if Vision gave him a wet willy and shut him off from the rest of the internet, that motherfucker has back ups of his back ups. There's a USB drive somewhere with his reboot program on it. Zola survived in a bunker for like 80 years as an AI. Ultron's got a way to do that, too. I'm sure of it.",,0,0,t1_cqum3i2,

To be fair, I doubt that was Whedon's idea. You have to keep in mind that most of every MCU film is decided by Marvel's higher-ups, who have to make sure everything fits in continuity and ties in to the next movie. And while I love how interlocked the MCU is, that comes at the cost of not giving the directors a whole lot of creative control, which is why Jon Favreau didn't do Iron Man 3, Edgar Wright didn't do Ant-Man, and Joss won't be doing Infinity War.",,0,0,t1_cqum3i2,

Also it would cheapen death and the moment the Avengers came together in Avengers 1. 

That doesn't rule out that Coulson will appear in the movies again under a different writer/director though. 

Plus it would eat up too much screen time to show each Avenger's reaction to Coulson coming back, the consequences of Fury lying to them, and the resurrection of SHIELD.

Avengers wont hold up other then the fact that they were all together. Now that the initial awesomeness of seeing all the characters together is gone, its lacking. I just got back from age of ultron and have to say that it honestly wont hold up as well as thor, iron man or winter soldier. It wasnt guardians lol funny, but it felt very sarcastic and just felt like one of those movies that is there to introduce new plot points(which was done best in winter soldier) so they can expand later. But most of the initial phase one movies will definitely hold up. Seeing all marvels plans for the future, im betting civil war, black panther, and ragnarok will hold up the best out of them all. Guardians was loved so much because of how different it was. It was an entire new plot. Not just the same hero beating up people, all so we can learn one new thing. But marvel movies still haven't hit that sweet spot of dark and funny. Winter soldier was perfect(i REALLY liked it obviously) because captain america is the most realistic character there. All the different directors taking on the same characters definitely shows. You see how the personality changes between director. Thats why im so happy that they are introducing all the new characters in phase 3. I can see those being more memorable then mOst of phase 2.

In terms of Iron Man. I'm 99% sure the point of this movie was to make people hate Tony. Keep in mind Civil War is coming up and sooner or later people are gonna have to pick sides. It's important to note that while his actions led to Ultron, his intentions were in the right place. That doesn't count for shit, but Tony isn't actually a bad guy, he's just incredibly self-absorbed and thinks his way is always the best way.

I have my fair share of upsets with the movies too, I think that the there should've been only two movies, way too much screen time went to the weirdo in the third movie, and the girl elf should not have existed (The issue is in this day and age when you don't have something like a 'Strong, independent' female character for the young female views to look up to, there's always an outrage from soccer moms somewhere). 

My best interpretation and argument for the movies is that they're supposed to be Bilbo's writings of the adventure in the Red Book, recounted with some over-dramatized, hyperbole that would make a fun story to read. It's not supposed to be the direct account from Bilbo's perspective on the journey to the Lonely Mountain. ",,0,0,t1_cqumilr,

Honestly I think this is more to do with the nature of the Hobbit as book than anything else. People seem to forget that the Hobbit is essentially a children's book. It's an extremely unusual situation; even though the Hobbit can be read as a direct prequel to the LotR trilogy, it is not even remotely similar in the way it was written. It reads like a bedtime story instead of an epic saga, like the LotR trilogy does.

The trilogy lends itself very well to translating directly into an epic set of movies because the trilogy is, well, *an epic*. Trying to turn a children's story full of silly, goofy characters and lighthearted themes into the same type of epic movie is significantly more difficult. 

This necessary translation is part of why people feel the Hobbit movies aren't true to the book: it's because they simply can't be. A set of movies that is faithful to the book would be a children's fairy tale more than an action/fantasy movie. Nothing really that Jackson could do about that, so whatever your opinions are on CGI and such, the fact is that the book itself was fundamentally different than the trilogy, so it's no surprise the movies did not translate as well.",,0,0,t1_cqumilr,

He had so many affectations in the writing of the dialogue that were Spaderisms, that the character simply wouldn't have worked without Spader in the role. He elevated Ultron to the mirror for Tony. That performance is what created Ultron's humanity and delivered the first villain in Marvel history that you could actually care about. I don't think this was the best Marvel movie, but it's the first Marvel movie where I honestly cared about every character.

Really, I think the most amazing thing about this film is that the script *was weak*. Marvel's crafting of their scripts to fit the larger Marvel narrative is really starting to show and I now can really understand why Edgar Wright walked on Ant Man. But here's the twist, I actually don't think that this is a bad thing.

Complete creative control rarely leads to greatness. You put an entire film on a single person's back and it takes on a personal tone that I don't think is appropriate for a cohesive universe across multiple films. It's more akin to large scale television, where you have different directors coming in on different 'episodes' and they're forced to work within certain creative limitations to insert their voice. Art bred through adversity. I think that is where Marvel's genius actually lies.

In Age of Ultron, Whedon was forced to work within the MCU limitations. He's also owed a great deal of credit for knowing when to get out of his performer's way, but he put together a really tremendous comic book film that is endlessly watchable.",,0,0,t1_cqumpt1,

The Hobbit is not a prequel to LotR, at least not stylistically. It's a VERY different type of book. It's almost a children's book when you compare it to the LotR trilogy, very lighthearted, lots of silly aspects (like you said). So it's not surprising to me at all that it would not provide the same epic value as the triology when turned into a movie. 

It's just a different type of book. I was going to try to give an analogy, but honestly I can't think of any other analog in literature that was translated to movies. It's just an extremely unusual situation where you have 4 books that are chronologically sequential (Hobbit-&gt;triology), however the first of those 4 books is a children's book while the other 3 are an epic saga, even though they can all be read as one continuous story. Very strange.

Kind of went off point, but TL;DR Hobbit is a children's book, trilogy is not, not surprising a children's book does not translate into an epic movie the same way the trilogy did.",,1430467707,0,t1_cqumvss,

Hey now, if we can do that, than the worst fight in Star Wars history is where Obi-Wan dies, that fight is terrible from an action standpoint. Action in movies has changed substantially, even in the last decade. Back when Phantom Menace released, there were very few lightening fast fights like that, I remember being blown away actually, and when everyone said that Darth Maul was a complete badass whom they killed off too early, remember that this was pretty much his only scene in the movie. He had a couple others but didn't do much until the end. Over time, people have become so jaded and hateful of the prequels that I think it blinds them to the fact that the fights themselves look and feel great. Sure, they may not have had any emotion because by the time they happen in the movies ""you're like WTF is this junk?!"" but I feel it's too dismissive to pick them apart.

And real quick to touch on the being hurt part, sure you are right, I mean sometimes people got force pushed and kicked around. They didn't break ribs and get jacked up like Luke did that time, but with lightsabers there's not much room for wounding. I mean, Anakin did get his hand cut off and his legs crushed, and then 3 limbs severed and burned alive. 

I can totally see how someone would think they're overly flashy though, I want to be clear. But when people start saying ""the lightsaber didn't even connect in that shot, look!"" it's just sad.",,0,0,t1_cqun3lp,

Luke dying was never the plan. In Vader mind he is sacrificing himself for Luke, a noble act. But when Sideous says, ""Now, you will die!"" It is no longer a sacrifice, and he has to make a choice.

The corporation and the hedge funds have a hold on Hollywood and they all want to make money on anything that signifies cinema. When you put $100 million and you get $800 million or $1 billion, it is very hard to convince people. You tell them, you will put in $20 million and you will get $80 million. Now, that is a f?ing amazing business, but they say, ?80 million? I want $800 million.?
&gt; ? sometimes enjoy them because they are basic and simple and go well with popcorn. The problem is that sometimes they purport to be profound, based on some Greek mythological kind of thing. And they are honestly very right wing. I always see them as killing people because they do not believe in what you believe, or they are not being who you want them to be. I hate that, and don? respond to those characters. They have been poison, this cultural genocide, because the audience is so overexposed to plot and explosions and shit that doesn? mean nothing about the experience of being human.

&gt;The idea of superheroes: ?uperheroes?ust the word hero bothers me. What the f? does that mean? It? a false, misleading conception, the superhero. Then, the way they apply violence to it, it? absolutely right wing. If you observe the mentality of most of those films, it? really about people who are rich, who have power, who will do the good, who will kill the bad. Philosophically, I just don? like them.

I wouldn't say they're not thoughtful. They're definitely condescending, but he deals with them on their own grounds (i.e. they're good popcorn flicks but don't really do much else). He's hugely critical, but he's certainly not as dismissive as someone saying ""lol, get a load of this Spanish guy, he knows big words!"".

I mean, you can totally say his comments fucking dumb, but Inarritu gave more credit here than he received.

The details that are there, are significant as they are trying to point to the larger philosophy at hand.
If there was a female CEO, that would have been distracting from the central character from the movie, which was not the CEO, or Caleb, or Kyoko (another reason she does not talk maybe), but the AI Ava.

Thanks. I thought the filmmakers made it a pretty digestible ending. It's not like they hide anything from you, it's all right there spelled out. And I'm not trying to sound pretentious, I just think the director wanted to make it clear that their relationship ended up almost entirely inverted. She can't completely bury the memory of the deceased because nobody mentally healthy does that. She feeds it worms to keep it alive and subservient. It shows that she's mastered her grief but isn't completely repressing it (which is unhealthy). She's trying to deal with it in a way most people ideally would. Keep the departed in our hearts but don't let  their memory control us.

A lot of people on these movie subs think it was a crap ending because they see it as trying to retain the spooky ""it's not over yet!"" mechanism. I believe it's as happy of an ending as a movie like this could get.

However, I simply didn't like the ending because I felt like it was inferred that it would happen the whole time. The whole grief trope was beaten to death and became the main antagonist pretty much as soon as you find out her husband is dead and she starts acting strangely. She obviously resents her child because he reminds her of what she had. After those become evident, the movie just sort of circles continually around those facts and ends exactly how you'd expect.

I think it was a fresh twist on horror, but nothing nearly what it is hyped as or what it could have been.",,0,0,t1_cquos4k,

Now, his argument is flawed because the recent superheroes fought things no one else could fight (like Zod) but he's clearly not too dumb to understand the term.

Topography is hard to get exactly right, if I remember correctly the film was taped in Australia though many of the Jungle shots were taken in Guadalcanal itself. 

The novel the movie is based on, was written by a WWII veteran of the actions of Guadalcanal, and it is heavily implied that they books were thinly veiled memoirs of his times in the army.  Heck he even names one of the characters after himself.

The banzai charges are actually depicted fairly realistically at the end of the movie, used as a close in ambush as opposed to a long scheeching charge hokywood is fond of.

Finally, insubordination is the only constant in the military.  This bullshit they are feeding you about patriotism and company cohesion is propaganda from the 40s and 50s.  If you read any memoir the soldiers are constantly arguing with their officers.

Hell there were something on the order of 1,000,000 courts martial in WWII...

Some 2,864 soldiers were tried for desertion alone.

Like bland senators that are calling for mutant regulation or whatever. I understand the political commentary angle they were going for with the story, but elected representatives don't make great villains in a movie about people that shoot lasers from their eyes and have retractable razor claws and shit. Movies with characters that extreme really beg for a villain that you love to hate, and the X-men movies spend too much time making you LOVE Magneto and Mystique that you really end up without any absolute conflict.

The Babadook isn't so much a boogeyman but really a part of us. A part of us we don't like but it's always there. Like a shadow. She kept denying that part of her existed and hence made the shadow grow bigger and stronger. Denying her inability to cope with other things made the shadow even stronger. And hence, all the bad qualities she had grew to control her, showing her snap back at her son and all. Her shadow even mocked her by showing her husband and showing how she can't let him go. Once she started to acknowledge that side of her, she was able to accept it. She was able to regain control and her shadow became weaker. She kept it in the basement because it will always be with her since it is her shadow. You can't simply get rid of your bad qualities. All you can do is acknowledge your shadow and occasionally feed it (in this case, literally feed it worms) to show you haven't forgotten about it.

My take is that he could still kick Vader's ass, we just never get a chance to see it. Between Episodes III and IV, Vader spent a lot of resources trying to track down Obi-Wan. No one ever went after Yoda. Emperor was smart enough to leave him the fuck alone as long as he stayed in exile and out of his hair.",,0,0,t1_cqupyfl,

I'm pretty disappointed that Whedon, again, left out a huge chunk of actual explanation in favor of fight scenes going on too long and mumbled clever dialogue. Don't get me wrong, I love the quips, but we don't need 45 minutes of fighting. It's just not necessary. I'd much rather understand what the fuck is going on than watch them destroy every brick in a city for an hour. None of the visions felt adequately explained to me, I have no idea what the fuck Thor was seeing, I still don't fully understand what Ultron was doing the whole time, etc. But damn if I didn't watch Iron Man rack up billions of dollars in property damage. 

EDIT: I want to add, I think this is particularly damaging to the franchise because you're operating on a pyramid basis. Whedon is/was responsible for laying out the foundations for Infinity War, and I think he did a very poor job of it because, as I said, he *didn't actually explain the plot*. If you don't know the comics, it could take 4 or 5 watches of the film to actually understand everything that's going on, and I think he's losing a massive chunk of the audience with that approach. For example, in our theatre, no one (aside from those of us familiar with the comics) understood the credit scene with Thanos because none of them understood the concept of the Infinity Stones and the Infinity Gauntlet. There was no solid explanation for what Vision's Stone did aside from ""mind stuff."" ",,1430497880,0,t1_cquqq1r,

I thought this submissions use of vertically blown-out lights to be distracting, they were initially exciting, but upon rematch quickly soured, especially in the dark. It's all so slick, like I am watching the intro for an episode of American Gladiator, or some other tacky sports program. It's so modern, and doesn't fit with the image I just now formed about Starlight Express. 

This also wasn't as dynamic in its pacing. I like your submission for how it was structured compared to this other entrant. Your entry opens with a compelling shot, and mostly delivers. The second shot you use isn't as exciting as some of the other shots, but it might just be the best option to set up your to story grow. It really does come to life in comparison, it feels much more like a stage show, and keeps punching through the end. 

This other entry you posted is flashy and sorta slick-ish, but lacks pizzazz beyond some tired VFX shenanigans and trendy looks. It comes down to who your judges are. Yours is like an 80's B-Movie to the other's tried-and-true sports-ball schick. Both are appealing to different people. ",,0,0,t1_cqur9dz,

One thing I *should* mention however - ""Rack &amp; Tackle"" is a videography service, first and foremost. The purpose of this film was to give insight to his cause and promote his ice fishing derby. He cherishes his personal privacy and getting a story out of the limits he sets can be quite restrictive, so I had to settle into more of a ""day in the life"" with Doug. That isn't to say I shouldn't attempt to tell a more dynamic story, so in future videos I'll definitely be watching for the hook and give it something more solid to start with. I'm currently working on a Turkey film for a client that will be a much more personal story, so it will be important to hit those marks.

As for music, I'll be working with the Blacksona to more-or-less hire him as a composer to solve the repetitive music. That's something I've been very aware of and addressing it!

But it's definitely not as great as its held up to be.  People keep singing praises about the story and directing but it's not anything extraordinary to me.  The pacing was off to me, too...and I like artsy/European films.

Like there are films that do this better.  Movies like Unforgiven or A History of Violence, where quiet sociopath types try to hide their true nature but are forced to reveal themselves.  To me, those films are better than Drive.

I really don't care. It's entertainment, and a film, and that's all I really need to accept the fact that what they do is not real sword fighting. I am not going to imagine that it's because they have supernatural abilities or anything. Because honestly, in *my* head, guys with supernatural abilities look a lot different fighting still. Because that's *my* imagination. Which there is nothing wrong with one person's interpretation or another. Especially when that interpretation is put on film and used as entertainment, and it *is* entertaining. Who cares if it is realistic or not, or if it matches what I thought in my head. What that fight choreographer came up with was cool and a neat style all their own, and it worked well with the lightsaber attacks and force abilities. It's just done for entertainment though, so don't forget that. Which is why I have a problem with a comparison made of the fighting being done in *film* and how *actual* swordfighting occurs, and done so by someone who doesn't really seem to know the first thing about actual fighting. Just accept that Star Wars films are entertainment, there will be inaccuracies when compared to real life, and there will be inconsistencies when compared to other interpretations from the imagination of fictional preternatural fighting. That's really all anyone has to say about it. Coming up with headcanon is a fun thought exercise, but don't lose track of the fact that film is still just film, and not even the same as what you're imagining in your mind's eye, let alone *reality*.",,0,0,t1_cqurjj8,

Weight loss and gain is calories in versus calories out.

It doesn't matter if he's eating gourmet organic whatever Whole Foods chef prepared meals or McDonalds. As long as he's eating more in calories than he's expending through being alive (and exercising, if he does any), he's going to gain weight.

Burgers and fries are burgers and fries whether he eats them at some grass fed gourmet Hollywood restaurant, at Red Robin, at McDonalds, or off his backyard grill. In terms of weight loss there is little difference in the calorie counts between them if the meat, toppings, bread and fries are all in the same proportions. 

Having money does allow you to make some healthier food choices when you choose your calories in terms of the quality of ingredients and maybe with some of your macros. And having money certainly means you could have someone like a chef or personal trainer or life coach basically monitoring how much you're consuming to keep you on track.

The dude is probably consuming 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day if he's that big. If he cut back to 2,000 calories a day he'd easily start losing the weight.

I wouldn't be surprised if heavy drinking was adding to his weight gain. Alcohol is a metric shit ton of calories.",,0,0,t1_cqurx2d,

 [**Pareto principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto%20principle): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Pareto principle__ (also known as the __80?0 rule__, the __law of the vital few,__ and the __principle of factor sparsity__) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.  [Management consultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consultant) [Joseph M. Juran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran) suggested the principle and named it after Italian [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist) [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto), who, while at the [University of Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lausanne) in 1896, published his first paper ""Cours d'?onomie politique."" Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population; Pareto developed the principle by observing that 20% of the pea pods in his garden contained 80% of the peas [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

&gt; See?

The cinematography was not era specific and really was quite modern in approach. If you are hoping that they have good cinematography in this project then, yea, obviously. You can say that about any film.

As for the script; that type of story-telling really isn't appropriate for the character-study that I think *Legend* is aspiring to be. Peaky Blinders (as good as it is) is a tv drama that centres around a crime family. It's a very different animal and therefore the structure of that story needs to be different.

If you are talking purely dialogue then I still disagree. They barely use any Brummy dialect (they barely get the accents right) in Peaky Blinders and if we get a Krays movie without the proper use of rhyming slang it isn't going to seem authentic at all.

&gt; How about because both are set after a world war and deal with an abundance of young men trying to figure out what to do with their lives.

How about one of them being set about a year after the First World War involving characters that fought in *that* very war. The other is set 10-15 years after the World War II had ended involving characters that never fought in it because they were 12 when it ended.  

It's hardly interchangeable, is it?

&gt; How about because both deal with organised crime in Britain, including the portrayal of the police force?

So all criminals and crime families are the same? Or are you just suggesting that every portrayal of organised crime has to be the same?

&gt; How about that even if they were set 2000 years apart, I can still use Peaky Blinders an an example of presenting its own Era well. Regardless of what time its set, it did a fantastic job of representing its time, and I hope this film does the same.

But that is trite and really says nothing at all. 

So, you hope it's good and you enjoy it as much as something else you enjoyed? Well that's revelatory. 

&gt; Birmingham and London are like 100 miles apart.

Having stayed for a few months in both cities for work I can tell you they are nothing alike. I can only imagine that in the past the differences were greater due to social mobility being far more limited.

&gt; They're still both set in post war Britain.

Yes and one of those wars involved the Blitz, meaning that the cities of Britain got fucked on. So even if your point was valid the state of the country after each war wouldn't exactly be identical. But your point isn't valid because one of them is going to be set in the 1960s 15 years after the war ended, while the other is set a year after a totally different war ended 40 years before the other.

You really are going to have to elaborate further on how you think these two settings are as closely linked as you suggest because I'm not seeing it.

&gt; North London is the main setting for half the story of season 2. Where Tom Hardy's character is introduced.

I like how you've phrased that. Ok, so it was *a* setting throughout Season 2. But how are the Jewish gangs from Camden that use intimidation tactics at race courses interchangeable with the Krays on Bethnal Green owning Night Clubs and eventually becoming criminal celebrities? Really, how much of season 2 is usable for this Kray Biopic? I don't think there's that much at all.",,0,0,t1_cqush4s,

I get that people don't like the changes, like I mentioned earlier I'm not a fan either, but most of the changes aren't that big a deal are they? I'm a Star Wars fan but I feel some people get too caught up on things being the original as if a CG dewback ruined the remastered films.

Not by default.  Skipping 1 is an *option* in the Machete Order, on the grounds that:

Though I have to disagree with the 'no important information' aspect.

I have some uncles who spent close to 10 years in prison before being let go. A lot of people also got executed or disappeared. Life was pretty shitty and hellish for families who were southern sympathizers or military or political - my grandma and grandpa weren't allowed to really get jobs so they'd do things like chop firewood and sell it to get by and rely on whatever savings they had hidden away. It was pretty common back then to buy solid gold bars and hide them somewhere til you needed cash, basically an under the mattress investment. That's how my family subsided for much of the postwar years.

My grandfather was a Colonel in the [RVNMD, the Vietnamese marines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam_Marine_Division). Went to officer school at Fort Benning, GA as part of an officer exchange program and everything, so he was a career military man. I don't know exactly which division he was in, but I know he saw a lot of heavy combat in Da Nang. Anyway, after being wounded his third time (artillery or mortar shell landed near him, nearly killed him and a piece of shrapnel lodged in his spine so he had to walk with a cane the rest of his life), he couldn't be a combatant anymore so they stationed him as District chief in a district called Di An, about 15km outside of Saigon. His job was basically to man the militia garrison protecting the district and work with Americans on intelligence gathering and logistical planning.

When the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) rolled in, a lot of his American friends told him to leave with them, but he was too stubborn, so he, my grandmother, and their six kids stayed. I can't imagine the terror they must have felt when, at some point, they lost contact with Bien Hoa airbase - this was like being in Washington DC and losing contact with Andrews Air Force Base. My grandma told me that the evening of the 29th, she could see the silhouettes of helicopter after helicopter taking off from Saigon and smoke in the distance north of Di An. They stayed in Di An (my grandfather was really devoted to his country), and he had his men basically fortify and take up defensive positions around the district. My mom and her siblings were in Saigon with their grandparents at this point, since there was *literally* nowhere else to go - the city was practically surrounded on all sides. Grandma is tough as nails, so she actually stays in Di An with her husband, knowing what might happen. 

The morning of the 30th, around 5am, my grandpa gives the command to withdraw after a really tense night that they thought they weren't going to survive. My grandparents pack up the jeeps - my grandfather and his wife and all his senior officers in one jeep, then all the rest following in a convoy. The highway is packed with literally an ENTIRE COUNTRY fleeing south.  Wounded soldiers, families, kids, you name it. Hundreds of thousands flooding the highway, many of them walking. My grandma told me that they were so close to the action that, after they crossed one of the major bridges into Saigon, ARVN engineers cleared the bridge and demolished it to slow the NVA. After an extremely dangerous trip that takes hours (normally it only takes 20 minutes to get to Saigon from Di An), they're entering the city and it's utter chaos. People running around confused, debris everywhere, wounded in the street, people trying to find their families. They eventually find their kids safe and sound. At around 10 in the morning, it's announced on the radio that South Vietnam is surrendering, and there's a call to all soldiers to disarm and go home to their families. This is, without a doubt, the most traumatizing moment in the lives of all of my grandparent's generation. My grandparents said it was like being told one day that the USA doesn't exist anymore, after fighting for decades to save it.

My grandpa got thrown into labor prison for a few years. My grandma actually had to trek up and down the country with her eldest daughter looking for him and bribed the guards at his camp to let him out - this was going on all over the country in the postwar years. According to her, the reason it worked was cause my grandpa was so disabled from his war wounds that he wasn't too great for labor so they let him go. 

The thing about the Northern regime though is that after the victory, they heavily persecuted anybody who worked with the south. So they'd harass my family a lot, and at one point they came to take my grandpa away again. According to my mom, he swallowed a bottle of pills in the bathroom. Somehow his other daughter convinces him to vomit it up, but he still ends up comatose and in the hospital for a week. My grandma eventually snuck him out under a gurney covered with sheets. After that little incident, my grandma made the call to take the whole family into hiding and they start to plan an escape. For the next 2 years, they move from place to place, staying at friends or family's houses, but never for more than a month or 2 at a time.

My grandpa leaves first in 1977 or 78 and goes on his own on a boat of refugees (he went without his wife and kids he was a high priority target due to his rank, so therefore traveling with his family would have put them all in danger). They land in Thailand (I think), and he gets processed and sent to the states because of his service to the Americans. He arrives in Thailand with literally no possessions except his shorts. 1979, my grandma puts together the last of her savings, and orchestrates a pretty spectacular escape involving 80 people. She has people gather information for months on coast guard patrol patterns, meticulously separated people into small groups that would move together on the day of the escape from various points in the city to avoid suspicion, rendezvous at specific hiding places on one of the Saigon rivers, etc. They're disguised as a fishing boat so they leave with the fishing boats out from the coast in the morning, but they don't return - instead, they turned south towards Malaysia. 

A crazy week long journey ensues, where my grandmother at one point talks their way out of being arrested by some coast guards, and they survive some horrendous rough waves that nearly capsize the boat. They arrive off the coast of Malaysia, but the engine dies. The current slowly pushes them towards shore. When it's close enough, my grandma has the men help everyone off and they wade to shore. At this time (1979), Malaysia was not taking any more refugees if they could help it (something not commonly known is that the South Pacific Asian countries at that time got slammed with millions of Vietnamese refugees so everyone had their hands full). My grandma knew this, so she and some of the men sabotage the ship so it's permanently toast - that way, the Malaysian coast guard wouldn't be able to force them to get back on and go elsewhere. 

She wades to shore herself, gathers her family, and the Malaysian coast guard takes the whole group of 80 and gets them to a refugee camp that's full to the brim with Vietnamese refugees. They stayed there for about 6 months until my Grandpa (who had made it to the states at this point) gets their paperwork in order and arranges a flight for them to the US. 

They arrive in 1980 in Salinas CA. Eventually, they move to the Silicon Valley because the schools were better there and have lived there ever since. My grandma ended up working as a medical translator at one of Stanford's hospitals, and my grandpa opened up an office to help refugees find work and housing. They helped put their kids through college, and all of the children settled in the Bay Area and had kids of their own. 

So things turned out pretty well for my family, although not everyone was that lucky :(",,1430472671,0,t1_cqut7t7,

They have Doctor Strange, Antman, Black Panther, Captain Marvel and Spiderman about to show up, so I think the universe would be okay if, instead of recasting Iron Man, they just dropped him entirely. I understand they've got brand recognition at the moment, but if they're already losing RDJ I don't know that they need to keep Tony Stark.

Moving forward, we could have others take up the mantle of Captain America, have a new sorceror supreme, there's precedent for passing on the title/powers of Antman, we could get Miles Morales showing up eventually to replace Parker, Black Panther is already a hereditary title, there have kind of been different incarnations of Thor, Captain Marvel gets passed around too.

Only A New Hope is finished so far, and it isn't available in HD; the sources adywan (the fan-editor) had access to while working on the first film were all SD, and since he no longer has the original project files, for HD he'll have to completely rebuild it all, which he's not planning on returning to do until he's completed the trilogy (we may be close to a release of Empire Strikes Back Revisited this year or next). Still, even in SD and lacking the more refined skills he's developed while laboring over both edits, the original work he did single-handedly is incredible, and I consider it to be the definitive version as well as what the Special Editions should have always been.

ESB:R has been a long time coming, because he's still editing by himself, but this time he's gone so far as to have volunteers do reshoots in order to correct continuity errors and such.

For ANH:R, at least, he released both a 'purist edition' that contained only technical fixes like color correction, re-rotoscoping every saber blade and blaster bolt in the movie, removal of Lucas' SE nonsense and the full fan-edit with a huge amount of fixes and tweaks, including somehow making the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader feel kinetic and dangerous instead of kind of slow and clunky, and giving Chewie a medal in the end like everyone else because he's not Han's dog, haha. No idea if he'll do the same for ESB:R, but my preference runs to the full edit anyway. Look over the edit list here if you're curious: https://swrevisited.wordpress.com/anhr-change-list/

It'll be interesting to see what he does with RotJ when he gets there; I believe he's said he intends to make more actual structural/story changes to it than to the first two due to RotJ generally suffering from/displaying the beginnings of the jaded Lucas of the prequels.",,0,0,t1_cqutevm,

Yes, sometimes it's frustrating that a movie is hard to find, or not available for digital download, or only available to buy or not to rent.  Sometimes Hollywood makes stupid decisions that are frustrating for the consumer.  However, if you actually enjoy movies and want hollywood to continue to make movies you enjoy, downloading them for free without compensating the studio, the actors, or the lowest paid members of the crew, is not the way that happens.

It's like he's grown quite complacent that either JARVIS will be able to handle everything for him, or that he's so smart he'll be able to wing it if anything goes wrong. I guess it goes with the general theme of his hubris. He just never considered he might be making a mistake. Or if he did, he never considered that he wouldn't be able to fix it immediately. Also, I think he kind of thinks the key to breakthroughs is allowing for mistakes and quirks? Probably figures it's what allows his AIs to learn/evolve. That's why he was so fond of that robot arm. 

Learning from mistakes. That may be a thing to understand. He believes in learning from mistakes. But he knows he's a genius, and he's an addict and is probably bored by his own self-confidence.

Basically all the pain and sweating and puking (the severe flu like symptoms) last maybe 2 weeks tops.

PAWS is what happens after the flu that where, despite not having any physical withdrawal symptoms you still feel like shit, can't sleep or sleep too much, usually get severely depressed and have 24/7 anxiety, have intense cravings for opiates, lethargy, etc. These symptoms last months or years and is a big part of why users relapse. 

When you think about it, the acute stuff is easier. You can lock yourself in your room and just lay in bed like anyone with the flu would.

[This] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook) is a pretty good critique of the experiment from Psychology Today. But I'll summarize

I'll briefly mention that the size and relative homogeneity of the test subjects can't be extrapolated to the wider population. These were 21 college aged males whose only experience with prison was movies and media reports. This created a stereotyped view of the roles they were meant to play.

They were also told what the conclusion that Zimbardo was trying to prove. Others have made this point before me: if they were told that the point of the experiment was to prove that people can be good and decent, even when put into power dynamic role, then that would have likely been the result.

The biggest flaw, IMO, is that Zimbardo put himself in the experiment as the superintendent. This is probably the most unethical part of this exercise. It suffers from confirmation bias to the most extreme degree. He deliberately created more stress and tension until ultimately calling the experiment off, so as to come out looking like a saviour. The problem is that there are so many factors at work here that it's impossible to draw a meaningful conclusion. 

So yes, it was both highly unethical and the conclusion reached is dubious at best, completely meaningless at worst. It was a waste of time and money. 

The worst part is that this is a very famous study (also probably on purpose by Zimbardo) that the general population take at face value without understanding the glaring problems. It should be removed from all psych 101 texts and only used as an example of poor experimental design.

To be fair though...the Avengers are fighting an out-of-context threat and Batman spends his time helping criminals get convicted. Sure, he's an unaccountable factor but he sends people to court, not bodybags.

This is one of the reasons I didn't like that they brought in the no-killing rule without explaining. They should have just had Batman explain that he doesn't do so because it's better for the city if people see Marcone get convicted in a court of law and not killed by thugs.",,0,0,t1_cquvlx8,

Kinda feels like you did.

&gt; No idea why you've decided to take a such a lengthy and wordy stand vs my innocuous comment.

Well technically I wrote it in response to your more wordy comment which was full of things that didn't really ring true. But to answer your question more directly; basically I was on my dinner at work, got bored, checked reddit and saw your reply.

&gt; You've completely misconstrued my point and gone on a sarcastic rant instead.

I'd use the word 'deconstruct' rather than 'misconstrue', although I am sarcastic, I'll give you that. Rant is a bit much though.

&gt; Let alone trying to lecture a Londener with a Brummy partner about the two cities.

You say that like I knew and that being the case supersedes any argument that I've made or personal experience I've had. I mean, you're not giving any sort of counter to anything I said about the cities that you supposedly know everything about. Instead you're just playing the big 'I am'. ... at least that proves you're from London, eh?

&gt; The top comment of this thread is ""Looks good, sold"", yet for some reason I'm "" trite"" enough to deserve a talking to.

The film definitely holds up.  It's one of my all time favorites.  But it holds up so well because most of the tension is built up with the dinosaurs off screen.  You don't even see the raptors into well over an hour in the movie.  That way Spielberg was able to get a whole lot of mileage out of very little footage.

In stores you pay an extra $7 ($27) and you get the Blu-Ray (physical), DVD (physical), and Digital copy.  How is it justifiable to charge 75% for arguably at most 1/3 of the product.

I think its pretty safe to say that game and music piracy has decreased since the introduction of iTunes, Spotify, Steam and other similar services.  This would suggest that piracy isn't a refusal to pay for things, but rather a difference in opinion on *how* to pay for things.  ",,0,0,t1_cqux80q,

I agree with this. Though I did not mean to imply that it had an agenda. But rather the movie manages to make us project some of out own prejudices on it and we see it through that light.

I actually just finished reading the screenplay. It is available at all the ebook outlets for whatever reader you have.

There are some parts that I do not remember seeing in the movie, and other details that come forth that emphasizes points that were not made in the film. And it clears a couple of minor questions. But I would need to see the movie again to be sure on some aspects of this. It clears up both the issues that people have had with the charging and the helicopter pilot. 

It really elucidates some points that I have made, and invalidates others. I would change some analysis' I have made. There is one critical point that is extremely subtle that actually gives insight into how Ava's AI might work. 

The part where she is smiling/laughing (if she did, I do not recall it) at the end as she goes up the stairs is actually a mistake the actress makes. And the look back as she leaves was likely added later. Otherwise it may have seemed that she had forgotten about Caleb. 

The thing with the key cards and the door to the den is not entirely cleared up. But Ava does close the door, and it apparently locks by itself. But Ava does get Nathan's key pass to make the final escape up the elevator.

So, the final analysis, and what makes the movie really good, is that Nathan really tells the truth about everything. One might argue how he has a  personality disorder (maybe *or just rich*) but for all his perceived horribleness, he is correct and is always truthful. 

So when we project either a bad/sad or ""extremely satisfied"" feelings about the movie, we are actually falling for the same things that Caleb does, but differently. The movie works to use our preconceived emotions of morality (whatever they are) with what Nathan is doing against us. So we pass judgement on Nathan, then judgement is passed on us in a way at the ending.

What is not made too clear in the movie is that Kyoko is the model that comes right before Ava did, and it had all the functionality that Ava did including speech. But what he did was essentially ""lobotomize"" her to a lower functioning level.

If people look deeper, they might see that Caleb was probably brought there to overcome another different problem he was having with the robots as much as to perform a complicated ""Turing test"" (on top of the ineffectual Turing test that Caleb proceeds with). That's why there were several robots, and why Ava was not the final version. 

But, the thing is, when Ava steps out of the facility, ~~she~~ it has ""not evolved"" in the sense of becoming a human sentient intelligence, but rather ~~she~~ it has become *better* at its programming. A really important distinction that I think is lost on many techies that want to embrace AI whatever that means.

I think that's where your razor is needed!",,1430495044,0,t1_cquxbj7,

I'd put them on par with movies like Speed Racer or the more recent Transformer (s?). Lots of colors and sounds, all boredom. Of course they were always going to make a zillion dollars no matter what, because they could rely on two large groups to buy tickets:

1) Star Wars fans

2) Families with kids

I think it's telling though that the Phantom Menace made a lot more than the following two.  Compare that to the Lord of the Rings: each installment made more than the previous.  I cant prove it, but if the movies were better, i bet they would have made a shitton more (like I'm hoping thr new ones do).  In any case, Lucas is a genius at one thing: pointlessly shoehorning in tons of shit that will make good toys and make more money.  He is NOT a good director or screenwriter, at least not anymore.

If these films were so successful, why do you think Abrams has clearly strayed away from their look and feel? Why didn't he follow the formula and instead move back to the style of the originals? Why did Disney hire him anyway? Because he has a proven track record of resurrecting and refreshing series that have gotten stale and cartoonish and making movies that feel real.

Did you know there's a documentary called *The People vs. George Lucas*? Apparently there are so many people dissatisfied with these movies that they made a *movie* about it. Can you imagine that happening for anyone else? Peter Jackson followed up his beloved trilogy with a silly, mediocre one. But I bet there isn't going to be a *People vs. Peter Jackson*. Because cringey as they are, the new films still include some substance and don't detract from the originals (now we all know Darth Vader was a pouty faced whiner who was tricked into joining the Dark Side over some vague promise to save the life of his ridiculous romance. And Yoda is an idiot who couldn't sense a Sith if he were sitting on his face). I likewise predict there will be no similar feelings of disgust for JJ Abrams after this trilogy. He knows what he's doing.

Oh and I don't owe anyone anything. I paid for my tickets and was served three turds. I only went to the last one because a couple people said it was good and dark. It turned out to be a darker-colored turd. But ended with a pretty funny line from Vader: ""noooooooo""!",,0,0,t1_cquxf1p,

What's the value of a movie?  The compensation is a fucked up backwards system where you can be dead yet what you created has some sort of 'value'. 

If someone creates a graphic layout image and you share it on Facebook, it's the same thing in principal.  You've just pirated said image which has a perceived value of $20 per copy.

I'm not saying that these creations should be free but the value isn't defined at all.

Hollywood says each movie which costs a millions of dollars, should be worth X amount no matter what.  The problem is that it's art and art is subjective.  When it doesn't cost anything to make an exact duplicate and the technology to do so is democratized changes the value of what X is perceived to be.

Why is it worth $30 here but then 2 weeks, it's in the bargain bin for $5?  Whose to say that it isn't worth $0 then?

Truth is the crew already got paid.  This is just the investment part of the equation wanting their cash cow to maintain it's 'stock price'",,0,1,t1_cquxq96,

 [**Shadow (psychology)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow%20%28psychology%29): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In [Jungian psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_psychology), the __shadow__ or ""__shadow aspect__"" may refer to (1) an unconscious aspect of the personality which the conscious ego does not identify in itself. Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which a person is not fully conscious. There are, however, positive aspects which may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem)).  Contrary to a [Freudian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian) definition of shadow, therefore, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness, and may be positive or negative. ""Everyone carries a shadow,"" Jung wrote, ""and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.""  It may be (in part) one's link to more primitive animal instincts,  which are superseded during early childhood by the conscious mind.

Number five is kinda right, I mean I love horror movies, and it as been ages since I have been scared by one so I am always on the hunt for something new that might get me, but Aliens is just fucking awesome. It can go from a macho military movie to a slaughterhouse, into a tense horror movie, into an empowering badassathon(best word), and still have this incredible tension. But it might just be for me that the newt and ripley facehugger scene, and the alien in the water with newt scene both have places on my top 5 movie scene list (Or would, if I had one).

But when a projectionist accidentally changed not only the speed of the reels (making it NOT real-time) but also the order of the reels, Warhol liked and kept the change.   

&gt;Warhol employed Rob Trains to be the projectionist for a screening of the film. Trains miscalculated and mixed the order and speed of the reels for the eight-hour movie. After a positive review in The New York Times, Warhol actually liked the ?istake?and employed Trains for the entire summer.

This would ruin any in-movie theme of time passing.

Since none of them had any real experience with prison, they created characters based on movies and TV.  And since they knew what the experimenter wanted the result to be, they acted toward that result. That's why the guards all act like they're starring in the then-popular prison movie Cool Hand Luke, right down to the good-old-boy accents. 

It was basically telling untrained people to do an improv show for college credit, and like all beginner actors doing improv, they went with the easy stereotypes.

If you handed people some Star Wars storm trooper outfits and set up a fake Death Star, they'd put Luke Skywalker in the giant trash compactor.

1. They should stop casting Megan Fox in anything. I don't even think she would be good at porn. Her toe thumbs have more acting ability. The nuclear level of hotness doesn't mask her lack of acting ability.  

2. Long, 100% CG action shots are just the opposite: boring. It's manufactured filler that doesn't add to the story because everyone knows it's not real and therefore no one cares. Sliding down a mountain in the snow with a semi and the inevitable cliff at the end? Yawn.  

3. Figure out what their limitations are early on and stick to them, within the same movie at least. Tossing shipping containers is one thing. Holding up a giant antenna while being attacked by your nemesis is another thing entirely. Also, bullet proof? I like what they did with the size of them. It makes sense that they'd be huge, strong and relatively intelligent. But bullet proof? Meh.  

4. The April O'Neill connection actually makes sense, but they just spent so much time beating it into our heads that they share this special connection that eventually I just didn't care anymore. Same goes for her dad's heroism. It could have been covered once, mentioned once later on and that would have been enough.  

5. The explanation for the name of the the Foot Clan is probably the funniest line in the movie and that's a bad thing. It's so ridiculously over dramatic and heavy-handed. That's some Twilight-level bad writing.  

I know you didn't ask, but I rate it a 6 out of 10. I'll probably watch it again because my daughter liked it and I'm a huge Turtle fan from my childhood, but it could have been so much better.",,1430489946,0,t1_cquyxi0,

It had a plot a story and all aspects and I didn't enjoy it for the colors. Transformers the new one was just an action flick but PM was not nor were the others. Their focus on politics as an inclusion was way beyond that.

You were served three good movies that you're stuck up over for some reason of who knows what.

Darth Vader wasn't pouty faced or a whiner.

Why is there a divergence? Because an entirely new owner of the titles exists. Disney has been doing things a very specific way for a very long time, they don't care about critics or any of that shit, but what they do care about is profit. It is simply logical that rather than stay true to the original vision of the creator like LucasFilms did, that they would instead pander to all at least with the first iteration in an attempt to see if changes could generate more market share. If so then profit will rule but if metrics don't go that way then the others will be in the vein of time to produce and what makes money.

The prequels built an entire new generation. Like it or not, nostalgia doesn't matter much to kids and likewise  while many like the old movies just as many think they need a remaster or don't like the style. Just as many of us don't enjoy black and white.",,0,0,t1_cquyz9k,

You said that, and either meant it (sad) or someone is paying you to believe it and maybe you've convinced yourself of it. That second option is sad, and in this case worse than the first.

No one referenced by the article actually said that.  But for sake of argument, I think the bigger problem is that the demand for digital distribution encourages digital cinematography, all in service to cost reduction, which has the effect of worsening the art and here's why:

In order to make a passable image digitally, you can take shortcuts and just shoot.... sure you have to light it minimally but you'll get SOME kind of intelligible image even with mediocre lighting and nothing else.

In order to make a passable image optically, you need to be somewhat of an expert at scene composition, lighting, aperture and shutter settings, film processing/color timing, etc.  Nevermind getting a GOOD image, the baseline for making an intelligible image at all in the medium of film requires a lot more technical proficiency in the rudiments of controlling light.

The difference is that without new DP's cutting their teeth on film in film schools with access to old Arri/Aaton gear at a minimum, or better, Panavision's leased inventory of Panaflex Millenniums, GII's etc. the schools are going to crank out a bunch of mediocre DP's and the art will suffer for a generation or more... and it's already happening.

Sure I do think that people should see film in a theater.... that doesn't preclude seeing it at home *in addition*.  But nobody in the article was saying that.   I think it's the loss of the art and a TOTAL departure from good exhibition is what Spike and QT are truly upset about but not always best at articulating it because they're great people, very knowledgeable, but too immersed in their work to learn how to be public speakers.",,1430492188,0,t1_cquzaau,

He produced it too. Unless you can show me your source showing that Bay had infinitely more responsibility and control over the film than Spielberg.

Oh, you can't? Because that information isn't available to us. A producer can do many things. When a producer does a lot of things, they usually spend some amount of time on set. I can't find reports of Bay being present for much of filming, and nothing regarding his presence in pre-production or post-production.

Maybe he did all, like you seem to know, but I'm not going to spend time shitting on someone over a movie when I don't even know how much work they did on it.

Movies usually have a handful of producers, like TMNT. A couple of them were people whose sole job is to make sure a studio's movie is going to turn maximum profit. Those are the guys that are involved in pre, filming, and post. Those are the producers with a lot of influence. Movies also frequently have big names attached as producers for the big name's sales draw. Bay is associated with action, and Spielberg is associated with strong kid and family friendly films. Having their names on this gave them a wider draw for audiences. Beyond that, I'd doubt much involvement.

But yeah, you're a studio insider, so you have more specifics about the movie's production and each crew member's exact role so I won't argue with you anymore. I'll just jump on the totally ignorant and pointless Bay hate train with you.",,0,0,t1_cquzd4u,

I can deal with some cliches and fart jokes. It's marketed toward 13-year-olds, after all. That just comes with the territory. And I thought the chemistry among the four turtles was actually really, really good and funny in places.

The movie's biggest problem, though, was that it was just The April O'Neill Movie with also some Turtles sometimes. The turtles were so much fun to watch, but they were only in, like, 25% of the movie! The rest was just April's recycled quest to be taken seriously as a journalist.

If the second movie can actually focus on the turtles (you know, the title characters), it will, I think, be a fun, easy watch at the very least.",,0,0,t1_cquzehl,

Donatello.  He gets that nerd culture vibe i guess.  Not really personable in my opinion.  About as exciting as a bowl of plain noodles.  But very smart.  Not smart enough to invent a better weapon than a giant stick, but he was probably too focused on other things.

Raphael. There's a character child me could sink his teeth into.  Probably my first introduction to the brooding anti hero.  He was flawed.  He was tortured.  He was too damn real for those other air headed kids.  And sais.  Cool little three bladed daggers.  Sleek and restrained.

Ignoring information(Although there's not a source for anything on the link regarding how Hollywood is lying about piracy being harmful) that say they are ignoring it just to go after people, isn't illegal. Guess what, they wouldn't be able to go after people if those people weren't committing a crime. They're not falsifying their charges just for their own happiness. The people pirating are doing something illegal.

Locking content, while stupid, isn't illegal or all that bad. Is it great for people who want something they can't get? No, not at all. Still not a reason to steal, especially when there are ways to get around region locks.

I do think it's a great science fiction film, but it wasn't always considered that way.

&gt; 

I think he's wrong, because the recent superhero movies have villains that are just capital-e Evil and can't be dealt with in the usual ways, but look at Batman's father. He didn't need a Batsuit. He just tried for economic prosperity to drive away crime.

Now, he failed, but he had to, obviously. That's what he's talking about. It's not a binary. Batman doesn't have to punch people. The writers have set up  a situation where he must, without anyone feeling bad about that being how a billionaire spends his time, in a  way completely contrary to his dad. So we end up rooting for the billionaire punching people instead of the billionaire building a train or some shit.

Again, the whole point is that the mob wasn't just ""crime"" in Gotham. It was crime on steroids, basically the law. Which is why Batman isn't seen beating up innocent people or low-level thugs that don't have anything to do with that. In fact, I think everyone he hurts has something to do with the larger plot in the films. But maybe he's talking about the comics? ",,0,0,t1_cquzrqp,

Edit - Origin story for this who haven't heard this before:

http://theweek.com/captured/446321/fascinating-origin-story-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles
&gt; The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' origin story paid homage to the first issue of Daredevil from 1963, in which young Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive isotope while pushing an old blind man from the path of an oncoming truck. Eastman and Laird extrapolated that after the canister containing that isotope struck Murdock, it collided with a bystander who was carrying a fishbowl containing his pets ?four baby turtles. The turtles and the canister, which bore the initials T.C.R.I., fell down a grate into the sewer below, where they were discovered by an inquisitive rat, Splinter.

You can google this and there's a lot of sources on the subject.

I can agree with you on the pacing being a bit off on it. I think that's the problem with trying to cram in certain things to set up other stories, while trying to keep a contained story within it, and trying to keep it around the 2 hour mark as well. I thought Joss did a good job trying to trim it down to a more marketable run time, from what I've heard though, is the Blu-ray is going to have an extended addition that puts it over the 3 hour mark that might be more your cup of tea.

The article even has a non clickbait title, it tells you exactly what you need to know about the article.

Th have a deeper analysis in the article which justifies the headline. But this post doesn't do this, it puts a question in your head and the only way to find out is to click the link.

It clearly polarised the audience when it came out and was misunderstood by a large majority, as all great science fiction films tend to be. I think in that way it can be construed as the start of its significance. 

I feel the same way about Prometheus, in that it too will go the way of Alien and Blade Runner in being reappraised after an extended period of critical maligning. It too is a re-imagining of classic novels like Shelley's Frankenstein (and mythological tales) that retains the author's original themes and incorporates them in a proper way. I'd say it's thematically a closer film to Blade Runner than Alien, especially with regards to the creator/creation dynamic, the unbridled pursuit of knowledge and the hubris of man.

Crowdfunding is good for people who have a built in audience but not a large enough one to get a real deal. However, crowdinvesting would be more attractive to these people as they could establish and grow business relationships with investors who seek to see more successful films and after getting their feet wet with small investments will put up larger sums for greater returns with the people they now trust. It would also allow these people to raise real budgets and advance their careers rather then just kick out another ultra low indie with no stars.

Edit: I think the article was in Newsweek, I'll have a look around, it was where the BL guys try to defend the crowdfunding move, it's a site with a red thing up top and a box on the right with the titles of articles and bars that fill up as you read, if that rings any bells. ",,0,0,t1_cqv1hbh,

I'll give you that one. That's one.

&gt;he wanted a bunch of black actors to be in someone else's film just 'cause. 

Did you legitimately type this thinking ""yeah, he'll just accept that no problem"". If you give me a source and a movie I might actually be able to consider this even remotely a point.

&gt;he also talked a lot of shit about the green mile cos the only black guy in it was a ""magical negro"" or something.

That's a legitimate trope though. The ""magical negro"" is a legit trope in film/fiction and he didn't like it in Green Mile. Don't see why that's a reason to hate the man.

&gt;that's just one of a few reasons people don't really like him too much these days

Okay, but you said that every time a film about a black person is made by a white guy, he calls it racist. This. Isn't. True. You're. Bullshitting.

Because that's the example people like to whip out.

Then these assholes come and get him tortured and murdered. He knows it's coming and watches his friends all turn on him because they don't want the same fate. He figured it would happen but he isn't mad because he BELIEVES his sacrifice will only strengthen his teachings.

It's just really sad to see it all unfold. What really did it for me was the end when he's praying for the men that tortured him and the people who ignored him in his time of need.

PROS :

Movie theaters have better sound (most of the time, personally, I find it too loud)

You lose part of every frame due to aspect ratio.

CONS :

Costs too much for a ticket.

Costs too much for snacks.

Parking costs too much. (this one is optional, I live in LA, so we gotta pay to park)

Can't pause the movie if something comes up.

Have to sit next to people you really wouldn't want to while they flutter away on their phones.

Children crying.

You have to drive to the location at a specified time just to watch a movie, whereas at home it's whenever you want.


CONS look like PROS to me... and they outweigh them.  Sorry if that doesn't make me a film connoisseur (I'm not, by far), but this is reality to most people who just use movies as a form of escape and entertainment, like books or videogames, and not a lifestyle.",,0,0,t1_cqv224d,

I think this movie is about progress and scientific method. This fits more with the ingenieur that created Primer.

We have an ""official reality"", with some humans that hurt themselves and other people, because shit happens, and a ""real reality"", where their actions are related to some pigs' actions. The real reality has a determined mechanism, with a cause-effect cycle between apparently disconnected elements. However, as this cycle is unknown to these people, they tend to fit their actions into some explanation more related to the official reality.

The couple, first thanks to observation and later because of the scientific method (going to the library to do some research, immersing in the water in a trial and error process until the Eureka moment) finds a theory that gives an official reality nearer to the real reality that help to kill the cycle to make Progress.

(An interesting thing is that this new official reality is not the same as real reality, as they kill the sampler thinking he was the thief, but it is good enough to make progress.)

The normal person will find the piggipathy the freaky thing in the movie, although is the real thing, and the scientific method is based in trying to escape from the official reality to find models that help to find a better official reality, even if they find incomprension and penuries during this search.",,1430500573,0,t3_2lqc0k,

*It reminds me a little like Christopher Lee becoming suprisingly well known for a wacky little movie 'The Wicker Man' but nearly 30 years later when it was incredibly a highly loved cult classic to a new generation. ",,0,0,t3_2vz3hg,

Ultron was a great villain who was sassy and menacing at the same time with some great lines and performance by James Spader. 

The rest of the cast was great as always, especially the new recruits, and it really seemed as though they were having more fun with this one. Paul Bettant stole the show as The Vision.

The script brought up a lot as well as set up Phase  very well but sometimes felt uneven or overstuffed, Whedon's direction also seemed to be in the same vein. However, making Hawkeye and actually character and having the downtime between fights be either as fun or thrilling as the fights themselves was accomplished well.

- For someone who's supposed to be great at writing female characters, Whedon has treated Black Widow pretty awfully IMO. Why on earth is she even having romantic tension with the likes of Hawkeye, Cap and now Banner? Yes, this movie has established that she and Hawkeye and Cap are just friends, but past movies have certainly created the impression of her flitting around a fair bit. 
- Oh, and in addition to that, that whole conversation about her being sterile was incredibly awkward. It made it seem like having babies was some kind of profound, important thing for her, and that her life wouldn't be complete without that. I get that her past was traumatic and that Bruce feels that he's a danger to her as well, but why is having kids even a conversation at this point? 
- That whole 'Widow being captured' thing turned out to be completely pointless. At no point was her life truly in danger, Banner just shows up and it's like 'ok, let's go'. So what was the point? Why did Ultron even care to keep her alive and a prisoner at all? Felt like princess syndrome to me.

[Paris, Texas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087884/)

A bleak and brilliant look at a man from the inside out. Stunning visuals, incredible score, brilliantly understated, and awe inspiring in it's plot resolution. My personal favourite film of all time.

[The Double Life of Veronique](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/)

Elusive and impenetrable poetry. Hypnotic, mesmerizing, and beautiful beyond words. 

[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/)

A sombre and atmospheric mood piece with gorgeous photography. One of the last great Westerns.

[Walkabout](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067959/)

Breathtaking portrayal of the duality of humanity. Haunting, poignant and a thought provoking study in culture clash disguised as a simple adventure story. Stark and uncompromising.

[Nosferatu the Vampyre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079641/)

Hypnotic and visually outstanding. In my opinion, the greatest Vampire film of all time. 

[Santa Sangre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098253/)

Incredibly unique and loaded with some of the best moments in cinema history. It's a surreal, macabre presentation of madness amidst images of grotesque beauty. A fascinating, disturbing, and metaphysical film. 

[Come and See](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/)

One of the greatest wars films ever made. Deals with the loss of of innocence in the Cruelties of War. Absolutely haunting and possibly traumatizing. Powerful beyond words.

[A Woman Under the Influence]
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072417/)

A courageous film with remarkable realism. A bruising portrait of mental illness thats gripping, honest and terribly real. Can't recommend it enough.

[Stroszek](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075276/)

The story of one man's incredible downfall. Dark, depressing, absurd, and hilarious. One of the greatest commentaries on the American Dream. 

[Deep Red](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073582/)

Simultaneously intriguing and brutal. Expressionistic lighting, a crazy composition, and graphically violent gore. Simply one of the best horror films ever made.

[Wake in Fright](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067541/)

A rugged and terrifying look at the harshness of the outback and the localized views of its people in 1970's Australia. Harrowing, brutal, and overall superb. A startlingly good film. 

[Woman in the Dunes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058625/)

One of, if not the best film analysis on existentialism. A deeply through provoking and expressionistic masterwork. 

[The Vanishing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096163/)

An absolutely chilling and deeply unsettling horror film. According to Stanley Kubrick, the scariest movie ever made. 

[The Devils](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993/)

Religious fundamentalism goes mad. Controversial, uncompromising and unforgettable.

[Alambrista!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075654/)

This film is almost entirely unheard of, but thankfully, Criterion has it available on bluray, and for good reason. With El Norte following close behind, this is without a doubt the most honest and visceral depiction of illegal immigrants trying to make a life for themselves in the US.

She definitely seemed like an inferior prototype of Ava. But I'm wondering how similar her consciousness is to Ava's because Nathan explained that Ava gets all of her information from that search engine and cameras. I'd imagine the same is true for Kyoto. Does this perhaps give Ava, Kyoto, and any other AI some sort of connection? Towards the end, it seemed like the motivations behind their actions were well-aligned even without them interacting with each other. 


Also, I think that Kyoto understood what everyone was saying, but she simply couldn't talk. I think that she was a prototype that didn't have the ability to interact, in a customary human way, for the purpose of exchanging ideas/thoughts. That's also why she never seemed to exhibit facial expressions. She had the same blank look on her face.

Marvel's plan for The Avengers movie worked, and it not only paved the way for every other property wanting a shared universe of movies, it taught the executives something that isn't great for stars and directors.

Basically, Marvel feels their characters sell their movies, not the directors or the actors. They brought on RDJ for Iron Man, because it was the first one, and have paid him *handsomely* to continue to be in the Marvel movies, but [the other actors didn't get nearly as much.](http://www.quora.com/How-much-did-each-actor-get-paid-to-star-in-The-Avengers) They pick actors who fit the roles but aren't quite household names yet and then sign them to a multi-picture deal for pennies. When stars bitched about how much they were being paid, they are replaced, [like Terrence Howard was for Iron Man 2.](http://screenrant.com/terrence-howard-iron-man-2-vic-4109/) or [Edward Norton after The Incredible Hulk.](http://www.slashfilm.com/the-truth-about-edward-norton-vs-marvel/) 

The exact same thing goes for directors. Marvel takes promising, but not quite big budget franchise directors, and gets them for pennies on the dollar, because they know that the directors understand that if they pull off a big budget comic book movie, then they'll have the clout to go on to do other big things. However, Marvel doesn't care at all about a ""director's vision"" and has a very specific template for how they want their movies to look (that's why they all look the same) and don't want too much creative flair in the writing or directing style. If the director isn't adhering to this template Marvel has created, they're replaced, [like Edgar Wright on Ant-Man](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-ant-man-director-edgar-707374) and [Patty Jenkins from Thor 2](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-marvel-fired-thor-2-273142).

The fact that Joss was directing the biggest franchise in the past 10 years, and *chose* to leave before finishing what could be the final crowning installment of a trilogy, tells me he's just doesn't like working with Marvel, who seem to be very controlling and don't pay very well at all for how well their movies are doing. Marvel feels their characters are the only thing that matters and seem to be building an assembly line to create a large series of movies that aren't very distinct from each other. When you look at it this way, it's not surprising that Whedon is now coming out and finally saying some off the wall things, now that he's no longer under Marvel's iron fist.",,0,0,t3_34e3cr,

I've been unimpressed with Zoom recorders build quality, but the Tascam seems solid. You can also power the Tascam with a cheap USB powerbank, which might be nice if you're away from an outlet for a while. All in all it's about the size of an average male hand, which is a bit smaller than the H6.

With the DR-70d you would be missing 2 channels of audio recording, but like the Zoom you can use the recorder's onboard mics (which actually sound pretty good themselves) for ambience, and still be left with 2 channels for a shotgun or wireless or whatever.

1. You're not using text, but rather images. Search engines can't index text from images and therefore you're not appearing in the relevant search results. This makes your message nearly impossible to find, unless someone's searching for something exceedingly specific, but then they probably already know about the project in the first place.

2. From the perspective of a journalist or blogger that might be interested in writing about your campaign, it's a lot of additional work to transcribe what's in your images, instead of merely copy/pasting parts of the text. With so many movies doing crowdfunding campaigns, why would someone spend extra time writing about your movie?

I don't know if you own your own studio or soundstage or know people or friends that already have the resources, but when I hear a story of a noir/greek mythology genre fusion along with motion capture technology I don't think 35k will cover the entire production. And I don't know if this is true or has been proven but when people see a kickstarter that has a low/modest figure people are less inclined to donate or they think the quality of the final product will not be good or the people involved are not committed, I'm not saying this about your kickstarter and I'm not attacking you. But I feel like if you're going to realize a very creative and visually distinctive movie then you should go for broke because you don't really have anything to lose regardless. I'm not saying ask for millions of dollars but maybe ask for at least 50K or more

Just thinking about the costs and ignoring the obvious requirements bumps up the budget like catering, securing locations, hiring production trucks. There are alot of little things that when combined rack up costs to a significant amount.

You also need to boil down the synopsis of the movie in a very easy to understand and palatable way so that anyone who watches it can understand, regardless of their knowledge of film. When I watched it I never got a clear idea of what the story was. I probably misheard it or didn't fully understand but if I'm not getting it then there are probably others who don't understand it either.

Also this is a very minor thing but seeing the photshopped pictures I can tell that you borrowed it from Sin City 2 and the other image from another movie. For me personally when I see that it kind of raises red flags in my mind. When you could have easily drawn or commissioned an artist to do that for you. 

Your pitch video is very good and is well edited and you know alot of interesting people that can help you and its smart that you highlighted that in the video. I don't know why more people aren't donating. Have you thought about going on other people's podcasts or shows and promoting the movie there?

This is further complicated by the fact that most parents don't ever want to see their children as sexually functional beings, despite the fact that from a purely biological standpoint, humans are primed for mating around 12-14 years of age. Biology (and the curiosity that follows it) couldn't give two shits about social norms.

A child that's too young to be curious about sex isn't interested in porn. By the time they're interested, it means they're curious. That doesn't mean it's okay to give them free reign to go hog wild on RedTube, but it means that they're at the age where sexuality needs to be discussed with them, or at least where the parents need to accept that their children are beginning to transition into what will eventually become a sexually active social creature.",,0,0,t3_34eujr,

A lot of this seemed a bit minimally scoped and somewhat disjointed that it keeps it from a cohesive message of any sort - I had a real hard time seeing how an ex porn star's life, the little girl, and the woman wanting surgery all interconnected. For example, the girl that got labiaplasty's storyline hardly talked about how much porn she's watched - they could have left it with the surgeon's really frank commentary that he just does some pretty simple cosmetic surgery in the end, no need to see a patient's potentially embarrassing story if you ask me.

What was missing for me was that I never got the perspective on adolescent sexuality from anyone other than people really deep in the sex industry or well-off rich kids. The kids that talked randomly were in good schools and neighborhood, hardly a bunch of hispanic girls, for example.

It was really, really hard to think of the little girl for me as anything other than a cherry picked example of today's youth given she's such a privileged girl that does have educated parents and whatever. I say this partly because in junior high when I was in an honors program half the girls in my class were like her while I knew a bunch of the girls in the other classes were giving blowjobs between classes and getting wasted and having three ways after school somewhat routinely. Some of those girls were actually from fairly privileged backgrounds, but most weren't either. The stories weren't exactly made up by 13 year olds to impress, I assure you (first and second hand experience kinda trumps it). Give the same kids access to instant photo sharing and it'll be chaos. Teen pregnancy was such a problem that my high school had a daycare for the students with over 30 kids out of maybe 1400 total students - this was in the late 90s.

You're not about to actually get to the girls that will admit to being very sexual that early in this kind of documentary and almost shows the kind of rather narrow audience that that they were able to talk to as the filmmakers. Maybe with completely anonymous interviews or something it might work, and the format in this documentary... kinda sucked for that kind of analysis.

With relatives with kids that are squarely in this documentary's scope, I think it'll be tough to get most of the parents that *should* be watching this documentary to actually go watch it to start a dialogue among themselves. The willfully ignorant parents or the ones like Amy Poehler's character in Mean Girls (what I knew would be prophetic years later) are the ones that will probably start seeing their 15 year old daughter knocked up or their football star son in the middle of a rape accusation scandal, not the ones in this documentary that try really hard to keep a clear, secure dialogue with their children while also making it clear that they're a parent, not just another friend.


Nothing in this film made me rethink anything. In fact, it kind of made me angry that this film seemed ignorant that kids were pretty damn sexualized even decades ago without porn and social media BS everywhere. Older generations had stuff like forest porn, finding daddy's porn stash, and kids sought this stuff out. Among girls, the ""popular"" girls were typically among the first to develop physically on top of their bubbly personalities. In many respects, for me the film made me think that kids are *less* sexualized than when I was a kid, which is completely the opposite of their message.",,0,0,t3_34eujr,

Are you a hardcore fan of the horror genre? If not, then it's probably not for you.

Are you a hardcore fan of the suspense genre? If not, then it's probably not for you.

Are you a hardcore fan of horror gore in general? If so, then it's probably not for you.

The Babadook should be required watching for any college electives that let you watch horror/suspense movies for credit. The cinematography is just amazing; you can tell that someone spent dozens of hours of their life making sure these shots came out as expected. The sound design is amazing; I'm not talking about the soundtrack, I mean the work of whoever is an audio equivalent of a gaffer.

Speaking of gaffers, they were on fucking point for this movie. Seriously, watch for the subtle changes in lighting and audio then think for a moment about the people who are never acknowledged because when their job is done properly the audience isn't supposed to notice.

""The Babadook"" is a definite team effort of a movie, don't be quick in assigning credit to the director or producer alone. Don't get turned off by people talking about how much they hated the child actor because for the first 1/2 - 3/4 of the film you're *supposed* to hate that kid. The negative things people have to say about the movie should outline just how perfectly the crew has done their job because most of the criticisms beyond ""this isn't my type of movie"" have to do with elements that are supposed to impact negatively with the audience and the people writing the reviews simply don't understand how much those little negative impacts can push a horror movie from ""good"" to ""great"".",,0,0,t3_34f0mg,

Indie films don't succeed or fail based on the notability of the cast, nor does it reliably play a major role in that determination. And yet, talk to small-scale distributors and sales agents, and that's nearly the only thing they ever talk about. 

Giving people a quick sound-bite answer that covers all of the combination of factors that actually goes into an indie being successful is pretty much impossible, of course. It's not a mathematical equation that lends itself to simplification. 

Another good example of the conundrums: Keeping your budget down is always a good idea. Keeping it under $150k is fine and dandy, and makes for a much smaller target for profitability. But it's also a possibly-quite-large limiting factor on the film's potential appeal, and thus on its ability to make any money at all. More people will see a movie that has a lot of production value behind it, and that includes paying for talent both before and behind the camera lens. You can make a movie for $100k quite easily, but if it's a poorly-written bottle story with two amateur actors performing under amateurish lighting and with bad sound and cheap post-production, very few people are going to want to pay money to see it. 

Quality usually costs. And it's never as simple as ""Get Eric Roberts to be in it!""",,0,0,t3_34fi0e,

I realized if these guys said something like ""How much would you think you need to make a real one?"" I have NO idea what sort of figure to level at them.

The entire number of spec spots that have actually been sold to their intended clients can probably be counted on one hand. Unless it is spectacularly well done, falls completely in line with their marketing, and there's no agency to get in the way to badmouth your work because they didn't do it, you won't sell it.

Spec spots exist to build out your reel. I've shot lots of them. I'll hook up with a director who has a big idea, I'll pull in some favors, we'll shoot it, and then use it to get paid work. You won't get hired unless you can show you can do the kinds of work you're going after, so spec spots are you going out and shooting that stuff on your own to prove you did it.

If you did a spec spot and you want to sell it, sit down and figure out how much it would have cost you if you'd done it for real and start at that figure. Actually, mark it up with your profit margin (20%ish) and THEN start negotiating.

NOW I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU A TON OF MONEY.

I've seen probably a dozen young companies drive themselves into ruin and bankruptcy by going into meetings like this and spitballing a budget. IT'S INCREDIBLY STUPID. Most of the time you'll underbid the gig without knowing what's involved and lose money on the deal. That is NOT the point of being in business.

You don't budget without a script and storyboards in hand. Then you go through and figure out what each element of that will cost. You add it up, add 10% as a contingency fee for when things go wrong, mark it up 20% for your profit, and submit it. If they don't go for it, ask them what you can cut to bring it into line with their budget expectations or tell them you'll present them with another idea that you can do on their budget... with your markup, of course. The markup and contingency fee are non-negotiable.

The point of this is to make a living doing this kind of work, so don't give it away and don't guess on budgets.

The smartest thing you could do is find an experienced line producer to bring on board who can budget this for you. Sometimes they'll do it for free contingent on getting the gig at their rate if the job awards. Many like to hook up with companies that are just starting out in the hope of becoming your number one call. I know several line producers who work that way.

They know all the hidden costs behind production and they will save your ass. Short of that, do the budget yourself. Find a template or something (you can probably find a copy of the AICP production template floating around somewhere) and fill it in.

James Spader as Ultron was fantastic casting, he gave Ultron such a wide spectrum of characteristics sometimes comedic and obviously very fucking terrifying and for me this was more-so because of the tonal quality of his voice rather than his obviously imposing 8ft build which towered over the Avengers. It was incredible to see Paul Bettany as Vision I should never have doubted how exactly he would perform after all this time being the voice of Jarvis with no physical form.

I also believe that the screen time for each of the Avengers was very well balanced this time around in AGO (Age of Ultron) compared to the first Avengers. I remember people breaking down the screen time for each member which showed that Tony Stark in and outside of the Iron Man suit had an overwhelming (for some people) amount of screen time. Not an easy job for Joss Whedon considering the size of AOU's cast.

The fight scenes throughout were incredible the best I've ever seen in ANY superhero movie, especially the cinematic and team scenes e.g. Thor striking Cap's shield to send it flying towards all of Ultrons army, causing a strike of lightening to cause a tremor and tear the ground apart in the beginning of the movie and finally the cinematic scene during the final fight shown partly in the trailer. The only gripe I have is that I feel the end fight ended too suddenly and I would loved to have seen a longer scene involving Ultron and Tony before the end of the movie.

Last point about the comedy and some surprises;

 The [Spoiler](/s ""GO TO SLEEP, GO TO SLEEP and missing tooth"") scene was hilarious during the Hulk and Hulkbuster fight and I have never In my life heard a cinema audience gasp louder than when [Spoiler](/s ""Vision handed Mj?nir to Thor "") completely unexpected.

TL;DR: Age of Ultron to me was near flawless, 9-10/10",,0,0,t3_34fmvw,

THAT'S what I felt he said. Literally zero reason I can see for people to call him a sell-out or an asshole. As long as you have him in your movie because he's a good actor for the part you have, and if you don't act like a dickhead, then it's okay!

Working on a indie film is good, when it's a good movie and the producer/writer/director are not inept at doing their jobs. I could kind of get his view if you sign on to a movie and not only are you getting paid jack shit but then you have to do all the marketing and talking to studios to convince the to pick up the movie cause the person that is meant to be doing that job sucks at it or they are just swept up in the idea of being an artist. 

I'm sure if he had to foresight to pick say a role in a indy like ex machina or buried he would be ok with it. The issue is you have no idea how a movie will turn out really till it's done. Sure you can have a good script but that can be fucked up by a bad cast or a bad director with a lack of vision or it could just be under budgeted and look cheap. Their are tons of way to fuck up a good script and really only 1 way to get it right. In the off chance the movie is great that still doesn't mean people will see it. it's all so easy to fuck the marketing of a good movie even with a major studios money it still happens eg Dredd, Edge of Tomorrow,The Iron Giant, Shawshank Redemption, Scarface. So if you make some movie for little to no money for it only to end up on VOD it's hardly a good move for your career and considering the fact he was unhireable till Iron-Man and Tropic Thunder relaunched his career.

IMO, it'd be better to show two back to back for 3 nights leading up to episode 7. People can sit through 2 no problem, and it let's them digest those chunks for the larger story arc points until they get to 7.

**Star Wars Despecialized** is a fan remastering of the original trilogy that surpasses the official digital ""remasters"" by parsecs.

The official digital remasters were made using cheap, cost-effective copies of the film. This means the color is washed out, and the quality is grainy. Not to mention, these versions were bastardized with unnecessary CGI and certain scenes (Like dead Jawa scene) were removed.

The fan-made Despecialized version of the films, however, are made using rare, high quality reels, compiled from foreign releases and special editions recovered by fans and enthusiasts themselves. This means the color is good as it was when it was first released, and the picture quality is through the roof.

  Beyond that, the Despecialized crew recoloured and retouched the videos frame-by-frame. C-3PO has never looked so golden.

**TL;DR - This is the best rendition of the original Star Wars trilogy you'll ever see.**

People are really over reacting to this.  I'm not saying that AMC and/or other theatres won't do a marathon.  I'm not even really doubting it.  That's what happens these days instead of midnight releases.  But this is far from a confirmation.

For one, its coming from some random and anonymous ""manager.""  **I** am a manager at a movie theatre (check my submission history to confirm if you'd like) and I can say for certain that a manager's word on something like this is useless.  A ""manager"" at a movie theatre can mean almost anything.  I was a ""manager"" at 19 years old simply because I knew how to stock the concession stand better than anyone else.  The title means almost nothing in the context of what inside secrets one might know.

But even **if** this were the General Manager of a specific location, even then it is unlikely they would know about something like this 7 months in advance.  I don't *anyone* **knows** that this would be happening.  I'm sure AMC would love to do it.  I'm sure Disney is interested in setting up something like it.  But there is little to no chance this has actually been officially scheduled or is any further than the very earliest planning stages at Disney.  These things just don't get scheduled and announced this early.  

What I honestly imagine happened, since the facebook post ""confirming"" the marathon is so sparse on details, is that whoever from ""Star Wars Action News"" called their local AMC, asked to speak to a manager (honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they just spoke to whatever employee answered the phone and assumed they were a manager), and asked if there would be a marathon.  And I feel fairly confident they would have gotten a non-committal ""probably, possibly"" type of answer and they took it as a definitive positive.

But, again, I certainly expect there will be some kind of marathon.  That's just what happens these days for new releases in big series.  But don't take this as an actual confirmation.",,0,0,t3_34g1z1,

First off, this has great production value. The audio is clear, photography is perfect, and there's absolutely nothing I can say that's negative in terms of production. However, I didn't really get anything out of this except for his MS. I think this focused more on his MS than actually him. Also, I watched the whole doc and there wasn't really a hook. He seemed like a nice guy, but there wasn't really anything noteworthy about this guy. Also, start off your doc with a bang. Watch Vice docs. They ALWAYS start off with a bang. So I would say just work on your delivery. Also, try different songs in your doc. The song you played all throughout the movie got a little tiring. Other than that, keep at it. You're definitely a better filmmaker and editor than me. Oh and your editing was great too. I just took some zzzquil, so excuse me if some parts aren't clear or don't make sense.

I managed to tense up during a showing of Alien even though I'd seen it a hundred times at home.

It's just unfortunate that the moviegoing masses have no sense of decorum any more, and that the lack of awareness (or lack of giving a shit about anybody else) translates across all age groups. I've had a row of seniors who wouldn't shut up, i've had teenagers fucking around on their phones and people in their 30s trying to pick fights because someone didn't sit down fast enough *before* the lights had even gone down for the previews.

**The First Seeder:**

1. A person has some content they wish to share.
2. They use their torrent client to create a .torrent file from the content and add the URL of private/public trackers (if desired) to facilitate initial communication between seeders and downloaders. 
3. They add the torrent in their own client and start seeding.
4. The torrent client sends a message to the trackers and provides the IP address of the seeder. 
5. They upload the .torrent file to 1 or more websites so that other people can access it. 

**Downloading:**

1. They find the .torrent on a website, download and add it into their torrent client. 
2. The torrent client will contact the trackers listed in the .torrent file to obtain a list of IP addresses of other people who are seeding or downloading the torrent. Initially this is just the IP address of the first seeder. 
3. The downloader's client connects directly to each of the IP addresses the tracker provided and starts to download. Once a piece has been downloaded it can also be uploaded to others (you don't need to be a seeder to upload). 
4. Once finished downloading the person becomes a seeder. There isn't a lot of difference between seeder and a leecher/downloader other than the fact that seeders are known to have 100% of the content. 

**DHT and Peer Exchange:**

This allows peers (seeders or downloaders) to find other peers without the help of a tracker. Peers will exchange information about other peers they know are seeding/downloading. 

**Pieces:**

The torrent is split into pieces so that you can verify each piece individually to make sure that it's correct. You can also download the pieces in any order and they will be combined to form a complete file. This is extremely helpful when initially seeding a torrent as shown with example: Imagine a torrent with 2 pieces and 2 people downloading from 1 initial seeder; the initial seeder would send a different piece to each downloader such that the 2 downloaders can help each other by sending the opposite part.

It's not underrated, it's not a gem, and it's not even obscure. The film looks and sounds great, better than even Man of Steel [as far as Snyder and other supergeeo ventures go], and it is brought up fairly often in this forum and others. 

Here are the most popular topics:

1. The opening scene [credits, etc...]

2. The changes from the graphic novel.

3. The different cuts of the film [theatrical, ultimate, director's]

4. The lack of visual effects Oscar nomination, methinks. 

5. The outstanding home video releases and near reference quality BluRay that came with some badass features. 

6. Snyder as an artist [I like him, but goddamn the people that love him go overboard] and the constant circle jerk or him being a ""visual director."" Saturation, no pun intended, of beautiful images is something I appreciate, but the shit is seriously sensory overload sometimes. 

7. Tangential bullshit about Sucker Punch, which gives me cancer as a debate.  Just stop, it's not some uber statement about feminism and the narrative fails to stimulate. Great action and set pieces, though. 

8. Alan Moore bullshit.",,0,0,t3_34gph6,

1. Actual hackers can't do **nearly** as much as movies/tv shows portray. Those ""whizz kids"" who exist to augment a movie or show's character and give the story an unreal edge? They don't exist in that form. They can't hack DMV databases in 5 minutes (Most not at all), they can't hack ""fbi mainframes"", and the list goes on and on. For example, the show Continuum's storyline is only possible because they have some little Canadian who can hack anything in &lt; 5 minutes. If they portrayed real hacking, then every time Kiera asked him to ""get her some information"", it would probably take him between 2 - 30 days to respond with it, if he even could.

2. And what real hackers can hack takes substantially longer. Long enough where any movie about realistic hacking would take place over weeks/months and not in between Seinfeld re-runs.",,0,0,t3_34gy31,

Studios seem convinced that the stakes have to global, all mankind is in danger and only the one true hacker can save the world. No, please stop. That is just lazy writing. 

You can make an incredible hacker film in many different genres. Balanced between social engineering and taking advantage of technology flaws, you can have horror, adventure, heist, romance, drama, Scifi etc.  

I'd love to see a spy vs spy type film where two convicted botnet users get out of prison and begin a personal war against the other, using all their skills to try to get the other sent back to prison as payback. 

Or a romcom where the woman is suspicious of her boyfriend and thus starts a brute force attack on her boyfriends email password - it'll take at least 30 days - so she tries all sorts of social engineering plots to try to gain access otherwise. The boyfriend is acting strange because he was buying a ring to propose, in the end, she discovers the password is her name in Greek, and she doesn't open the email. He proposes, and then she admits, she hacked him and he needs a more secure password. 

Make the stakes personal. Who cares if the ship sinks, what we cared about is Jack and Kate. Who cares about the stupid tree being blown to smithereens, what we care about is Jake and Neytiri. Who cares about the oil, we care about Daniel Plainview. It is possible to tell big stories and make big money and win tons of awards and critical acclaim.  ",,0,0,t3_34gy31,

Outside of the Whedonisms (*^which ^are ^becoming ^borderline ^annoying*) and platitudes and exposition... there's sparse actual dialogue. Everything is seriously rushed, like they can't talk fast enough just so they can get to the next plot point. And when they do talk it rarely ever feels like people having conversations, again it's mostly either exposition or grandstanding platitudes. 

The drone Ultrons must be held together with paperclips. Black Widow can punch these fucking things and you just watch them completely fall apart, like magically all the nuts/bolts disappeared and the rods and wiring and everything just crumbles down. Making them not a threat at all, they're on the same threat and usefulness level as the Star Wars prequel battle droids, which of course doesn't do well with regards to tension. 

Towards the very end, with regards to the almost escaped Ultron. My speculation: If they don't die on screen they don't die. Movie rule #7. Ultron, that final one, wasn't actually shown being destroyed. Camera pulled way back to behind a bunch of trees and Vision just had a big yellow glow happen. Mayhaps containing the consciousness of Ultron inside the Gem. Since Vision earlier said he didn't want to kill him since he's unique, but felt a duty to stop him. He achieves both ends this way. Plus allows for a future where Ultron ""*escapes*"" somehow to return a really bitter vengeful Ultron. 

Not to dump completely on this. It's still a good movie. Not great by any means, but pretty good. Opening hook was fun. The obligatory AVENGERS: ASSEMBLE! scene with everyone fighting by the button and camera panning 360 was fantastic. It's scenes like that which people want and this movie delivered it. Hulkbuster V Hulk fight is incredible. And to my amazement Hulkbuster... won!? Never thought I'd see that, but they needed Banner on the jet so yeah Hulk lost. With a final throwback to the Hulk punch Thor scene from the first Avengers. The scene with Thor and Tony talking about why Pepper and Jane are nowhere to be found I found hilarious and for some reason [reminded me of this moment](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2535/361/1600/VFX-AmazingSpider-Man529-005.jpg) breaking the 4th wall.

Wasn't horrible or anything but nothing in it really grabbed me, it just seemed like there were never any stakes or any real tension. Stuff just kinda happened for 2 and a half hours, the end. 

Edit: I was kind of vague in my initial review because I had just seen it and was still processing it. I think my main issue was that there weren't any moments where I was like ""Oh shit! What are they going to do now?!"" and there weren't any moments that just really blew me away. There were cool sequences, but none of them had enough drama to make them anything more than a kind of chuckle to myself ""that was cool"" moment. For example, the Dark Knight Rises is a mess of a movie, no doubt. But the first time I saw it there were still stand out moments where I was like ""Oh SHIT, I was NOT expecting that!?"" or just ""Woah, I can't believe this is happening!"" For this movie it puttered along well enough, but there just wasn't a single thing I would call great in it. 

Just look at this thread. The main things people are talking about are Vision picking up the hammer, Hawkeye getting ""character development"", and Quicksilver's death. Are any of those really amazing moments?! In a 2 and a half hour movie, the things people were most excited for lasted a mere couple of minutes in total, and IMO were all handled as weakly as possible. Hawkeye had some clever lines, but the movie didn't make me care about him. Quicksilver barely seemed like a character and more of a caricature, DOFP did him (and just about everything else) a million times better. I did get a kick out of the Vision Mjornir bit, but that's like a one-off joke for the fans that lasts seconds.
Ultron was okay. James Spader was perfect...but he basically took one guys arm off...that's literally it. You don't see a single person die...or even seem to be in any real peril. An army of robots is swarming over this place and no one seems to be harmed at all. And QS death comes so late that Ultron is already basically defeated. If they were going to do that, put it earlier when Ultron seems like having a chance of success...then it has some power behind it and makes Ultron more menacing. 

To not just be a negative nancy, there were good parts. I loved some of the action team-up between superhero sequences. That was pure comic book fun. Iron Man vs Hulkbuster was fun, and funnily enough it seemed like more people were in danger during that than when Ultron unleashes his attack. Scarlet Witch's powers were done well, but her acting kinda went in and out of being good. I liked War Machine a LOT in this film, he seemed to be one of the few people truly having fun. 

Like I said, didn't hate it. But on a first watch it felt like it should've had more ""OH MY GOD!"" moments, and it was mostly just kinda a muted ""That's kinda cool."" instead. I can think of some truly mediocre/bad movies that grabbed me more on a first watch. They subsequently fell apart with further watches, but they at least had a few tricks up their sleeve. That first watch I'm usually a sucker for, I let myself just go with the flow, and don't try to over-analyze the film...this just felt weak unfortunately, so how's it gonna feel if I watch it another couple of times? It's possible it will grow on me, but I'm skeptical.

Ultron looked bad. There are no two ways about it. He was obviously 100% CGI, and it showed. He wasn't an intimidating villain, either. This felt more like a ""How it Should Have Ended"" parody of Ultron rather than a villain.

Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch were impossible to give a damn about. Whedon said he found it impossible to balance all the characters, *and it shows.* When Quicksilver's dying words were a quip, it felt appropriate. His character was a joke.

The Hulk had no character exploration that hasn't formed its own beaten path and paved in on, where Thor didn't show any character exploration shown to explore.

Captain America and Iron Man were probably the high lights of this movie, but Whedon failed to balance the professional hatred they're building up with other plot points he didn't need.

I didn't like the Vision too much. He was cool, but his presence felt too powerful for the movie. Once he came onto screen there was a lot less tension.

Thor didn't do shit. Just found some convenient LSD water and took a bath.

I liked that Nick Fury and SHIELD were pushed into the background. Made the Avengers versus Ultron feel more intimate.

Terminator 2, arguably the best action movie ever, is a great example of a well-paced, large scale action movie. 

The dialogue and banter was great, the humour was on point. I found the cinematography a lot better this time around too. I liked that Hawkeye had a bigger role and more character development, and that lots of side characters like Rhodey and Falcon were incorporated. The Vision was also really well done.

This was the most boring movie I've ever been entertained by. It was good. I liked it. It was a good movie. But *something* was off. I'm going to keep typing until I figure out what.

It started out really well. The opening sequence at Strucker's complex was fantastic, and I loved that he *opened* on a one-shot of every Avenger doing their thing. Basically saying, ""you guys know what's up, we've done this before, let's just do this"", which was welcome, but the fact that it didn't heighten that much throughout the rest of the movie is part of why I wasn't as impressed.

Hawkeye was great. People are going on and on about how great it was that he got a background and a character, and honestly, I don't give a shit about that, I give a shit about him being funny and having a purpose in the film. His family life was a typical ""dangerous job, frightened, but understanding wife"" trope. I really don't understand why everyone's going on about how he's now a complete character when all they did was making him a boring trope. What *I* liked about the character is he wasn't just there. He was there with a purpose. He was funny. He convinced Scarlet Witch to get back in it. He did well. But I wish his family life weren't so... and it's weird to say this as ridiculous of a superhero movie as it is... typical.

Scarlet Witch was *really really really great*. I loved her character. I loved her movements, it was very alien, very ""witch""-like. And she was badass, which is what you want out of an action movie character. Really excited to see more of her, and she was miles ahead of other characters in the film.

Black Widow was a huge disappointment. I was pumped that more women were gonna be in the movie, but it seems like as one new woman rises another must become a stereotype. Whedon, you're calling Jurassic World sexist and then you thrust Black Widow out of the role of sarcastic spy agent who has a purpose and right into love interest who can't have kids (which TOTALLY MATTERS FOR A WOMAN, her life is RUINED because she can't be a MOM :( booo boooo this throwaway plot point) and is hurt and sent off twice and is fucking kidnapped and is more of a whimpering, emotional character than what she was set up as. I don't know if this was meant to be going into her character and giving her more, but it felt like giving her less by thrusting her into the classic action hero female tropes. It was disappointing.

Ultron. Ultron was all over the fucking place. One second he's a badass AI bent on world destruction, the next he's a whiny teenager. I get it. That's what he was. But it didn't work. It was scattershot, it was a HUGELY rushed character, and it was boring. Spader did a good job with the voice acting, but the character was too jumpy: going from quippy Stark clone to mega super villain to childish teen to silly murderer... blech. Such a waste. Thought Marvel finally had a good villain in their hands and then... nope.

Did I miss Julie Delphy? I was half-expecting her to show up as Madame Web or Captain Marvel. Did I just miss her?

**EDIT**: So Julie Delpy played the woman from Black Widow's flashbacks... Seems like a really small role. Kinda bummed, she's a great actress and that was a bit of a throwaway character. But I guess you could say the same about Andy Serkis.

**EDIT 2**: Okay, so I didn't know about Serkis' comic book character and apparently he'll be prevalent in Black Panther. Cool. Still doesn't explain why Delphy got a throwaway character.

Mid-credits scene was bullshit. Nothing we don't know already. Didn't tease anything we didn't already know. Yawn. Show me Spidey, show me... anything interesting.

I think that's what the issue was. Is that this movie was nothing more than an introduction to a few new characters. Nothing matters at the end. Hulk flying off isn't an ""oh no!"" because we all know he's coming back in the next one. Stark saying he's quitting is such bullshit because he's done it twice now and nobody believes him... the end of IM3 was meaningless now. This movie could've not existed. I feel like it was just filler. This movie suffered from being nothing more than a tease for things to come with a few average-but-not-great action sequences thrown in (except Hulkbuster... god damn that was fun). But the ending sequence was just all over the place. Hulk disappeared until he was needed. Fury was nothing but a Deus Ex Machina. It was teased as a movie primed to be darker and more serious, but it was just Whedon quippy dialogue that felt super out of place at times. A movie that's 2 and a half hours long shouldn't feel rushed. And that's what this movie was. Rushed. Packing too many characters in. Packing too much while feeling in the end like so little. 

It's still an entertaining movie. It's still fun. But it once again is showing me that Marvel is so goddamn formulaic. Even killing off Quicksilver fell flat because who gives a shit about a character who got literally zero development? I welcomed killing off Hawkeye, making his horror a reality and then they didn't. Also, Stark was a fucking piece of shit and no one called him on it. No one. Everyone was just too busy moving along to the next plot point that they didn't have time to fucking breathe, both in the script and in the characters' actions and emotions.

I don't know guys. I feel like the 75% on RT is well-deserved. Because this was really nothing special. A fun movie that strived to be much bigger than it was that's nothing more than servicing the grander picture. Which is really shouldn't. It should serve the bigger picture WHILE being its own entity. Nothing surprised me in this film. And I feel like nothing's going to surprise me in the future because it's all the same.

6.5/10 - Boring-taining. If that makes any sense at all. Empty fun that has no shame in striving to be better and being totally fine making billions failing.

**EDIT 3**: Some people are wondering why I didn't touch on Vision. I didn't get much out of him, I guess. His look was *way* too cartoonish to me (sorry if this upsets people, but I honestly think he looked ridiculous and way too obviously a man with paint on his face). He seemed like a magic problem solver. Little Deus Ex Machina for me. Ultron's creating a perfect body? Oop now he's on our side! Ultron has a network all across the web? Oop Vision can take him off the web by touching him. Thor's getting the shit kicked out of him? Oop Vision can carry his hammer. We haven't introduced the mind gem yet? Oop Vision! What were his powers? What was his purpose other than justifying Tony Starks horrible *horrible* AI decision? Like Stark made an enormous mistake, doesn't learn from it, isn't called out on it, and BOOM, no problem guys he was right to do it because now we have magic problem solving android thing that's somehow human I don't know he was very briefly described. And now Jarvis is gone. I loved Jarvis. Vision seems like Jarvis without a personality. So yeah. Sorry.

Vision was done perfectly. He's obviously more powerful than every other Avenger combined, but he's written in such a way that he is fun to watch, while still being as powerful as he should be. The Banner Romanov romance felt a little forced, and cringey at times. What happened to him being able to control it? That's basically gone out the window now.

- The action scenes were way too busy and the sheer amount of them hardly allowed for character development.

- The character development that they did try to do felt very forced and some conversations were highly out of place. Case in point is when quicksilver starts talking about his past to Ultron.

- The Bruce/Natasha storyline was unnecessary, out of place and not interesting.

- Ultron is not convincing as a villain at all. For a self-learning AI system he makes some terribly stupid decisions. Why would he not pull a Voldemort and store pieces of himself in different systems or whatever?

- Ultron goes from awake to 100% evil and fully developed character-wise in about 4 seconds. That relates back to the character development point earlier. Plus, Marvel movies just can't seem to get villains right. At no point did I feel like this was a menacing adversary.

- Vision pops out of that box and not a minute later he's a fully developed character that's accepted by everyone as part of the avengers.",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

-There was a few too many quips in the movie and some of them felt misplaced. It felt like when the action was really ramping up there would be a one liner and it would take me out of the moment

-Ultron was kind of whiny and not as menacing as he was made to seem. Too many jokes from him as well. Still better than most of Marvel's villains but that isn't saying much. 

-Hulk Buster fight ended abruptly. What happened in the end? Did Tony beat the Hulk into submission? Did Romanoff use another lullaby? Did SW's spell wear off and he came to his senses?

-Cap felt a little weak and a step down from TWS 

-Not sure this is a bad thing but the ending line! I was grinning from ear-to-ear in anticipation of hearing the line only to be blue balled.

I will say that parts of this were the most comic book movie I've ever seen. Like a real commitment to weird mythologizing and interactions. That Vision (who was incredibly well done) was not the weirdest thing in the movie is a testament to how strange other stuff was.

Ultron was a really good villain in my opinion. I may have gotten a few chills in his introduction scene. 

One of the main things people were saying in the UK thread, which I may or may not have peaked into a few times, was that it didn't really set up for Civil War, but I don't think it was supposed to. It was more a setup for Infinity War than anything, but there were hints of a rivalry between Cap and Tony.

I suppose it was leading up to that but it all came out of no where. I would have much prefered a longer film.

But in all honesty when it comes to Marvel films, Singer's X-Men films just feel more compelling to watch than most of the new MCU films. The only MCU movie that I really loved was the second Captain America movie. Others range from like to meh.

My biggest complaint against the MCU films is that they barely have strong, memorable or threatening villains. It makes most of their films lacking any real tension.

The only interesting villain to come out of the MCU films was Loki during the first Thor movie and even he was turned into a weak stereotypical villain and a joke punchline (for Hulk) during the first Avenger movie.

Ultron in this movie had the potential (with his connection to Stark's mentality) but fizzled out towards the second half of his appearance by becoming just like every other MCU villain, ""I am evil and I want to kill everyone hah hah hah hah hah..."" ",,1430453989,0,t3_34h0or,

*Age of Ultron* implies a lengthy and brutal conflict. X-Men: DoFP did an excellence job of creating a sense of urgency and danger, something sorely lacking in Marvel movies. 

I feel like Whedon was given a checklist of certain set pieces and events that had to happen, and he strung them together as best he could. *Make sure Hulkbuster fights Hulk*

I enjoyed this movie, as I usually do seeing heroes on the big screen, but the MCU lacks a certain darkness to make me buy into the conflict and story at large. 

Also MCU has a problem with over and under-powering certain heroes and villains. Ultron as a psychopathic robot made of vibranium *could* tear people in half, but instead he chooses to get into fist fights with them. ",,1430454660,0,t3_34h0or,

Didn't follow any of the hype, hadn't seen a superhero movie since Iron Man, and wasn't even planning on seeing it until a friend suggested we go. I don't know why, but it struck a chord with me. I loved every second of it. I felt like a kid watching the whole thing. I had a great experience and I just wanted more and more.

I had an insanely good time, so good that for awhile I was nearly obsessed with the MCU. I followed all the news I could, got hyped for every movie, every TV show, every one-shot. I waited pretty much impatiently for three years for Age of Ultron to come out. Sometimes it felt impossible, sometimes I totally forgot it was a thing. Near the end of the wait the hype started deflating. Maybe Marvel Movies aren't that cool, maybe I should grow up and start watching more adult movies and getting excited for those rather than salivating over the next Avengers film, maybe I should pay more attention to my real life. Then the reviews came in, everyone saying ""oh it's getting bad reviews, it's only at a 70 on Rotten Tomatoes"". The hype just kept going down. Getting myself entangled in the online superhero community was taking its toll.

But it's been a long three years, and I finally got to see Age of Ultron today, opening day. And I fucking LOVED it. It was exactly what I wanted. More character interaction, more team effort, more works building, more jokes, the list goes on. I had an amazing time. This literally felt like a continuation of my favorite movie of all time. Not just a cash in sequel, a continuation.

Did it have flaws? Of course. The original had flaws too. This one had some as well. The pacing was off in parts, Ultron wasn't the intimidating villain we were all promised, the scale was a bit smaller than I wanted, some of the world building was forced and I felt killing Quicksilver was a cop out move just to say ""oh someone actually died this time.""

But everything else was just fantastic. I had an amazing time. I'm so happy to have finally seen it. It was just straight up awesome. I get some people may not like it, some people may not be into superhero movies and others may have gotten themselves overhyped, but it was insane. 10/10 on the fun factor for me. Maybe 9/10 as an actual movie.

Vision's lines in the script were existentialist in a very superficial manner (yet honest and learned at least, since Whedon is maybe the best pop culture writer of existentialism in tv/film right now).

Paul Bettany - under an amazing work of makeup that makes him feel so much more of a character than Ultron did - made that fucking shit Shakespearean. His performance as Vision is probably my favorite I've seen since Heath Ledger's Joker. Before we even have him established as a factor for the film, he's taken command of the film with his initial speech to the team and felt humane and artificial at once (a balance that could have easily fallen down in the wrong actor's hands).

Bettany as Vision was perfect here.

Ultron had a great intro, you really understood his motives on what he felt needed to be done but after that he just turned into a cheese ball who was full himself and made jokes that left me unresponsive. I thought he was one of the least threatening villains so far.

But I really did enjoy learning new info about the characters and their interaction with each other. Made me feel like I was involved in their lives and made me care more about them.

* Whedon made every character the same, spouting witticisms at regular intervals. You can't have a serious tone when  everyone is dropping one liners all the time. In Avengers it kinda worked since Whedon did it sparringly with good lines and timing. It also works much better with characters that are inherently flippant, like Loki and Stark, not Captain America and Thor. In AOU it comes off as Whedon trying to hard and becomes a dancing monkey.

* The plot was meh, there was no sense of foreboding or serious threat from Ultron. The twins story was weak. Lot of scenes seems just inter-stitched to tick off boxes. Parts of the plot seemed grafted on just to make the hulk buster fight happen. The whole was not greater than its parts.

* Weak scenes. The party scene is pretty weak (except the hammer part which I thought was great),  all the ""mind control"" scenes were weak. The Thor taking a lightning jacuzzi was weak.  The cabin scenes drag alot.  The The first Avengers had great small scenes, Captain America and the punching bag, Loki in Germany,  Iron man disconnecting his building. Black Widow intro etc. Age of Ultron has very little of that.

* The love story element between Banner and Nad seemed forced and unnatural. Black Widow went backwards from being a somewhat strong character to being a love interest.

* Weak characters. Quicksilver left little impression and Scarlet Witch just a little more. 

* Pacing, the middle part of the movie really dragged and there was no good sense of tempo and urgency throughout.

* Weak Villain. The worst thing about Ultron was that he was the same wise cracking character as everyone else. The second worst thing was the character design. That guppyfish mouth really did not work for Ultron, in the series has an iconic super menacing grin (http://cdn.unleashthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ultron_Dialogue.png?4dbf7b, why take that away? Ultron kept spouting off megamanical things, but without much substance or coherence, reducing him to a stereotype. Ultron could have been so cool, he has a superior intellect, is a brilliant strategist, and has powers like the ""encephalo-ray"" which places victims into a deathlike coma. He really needed to be a cold unstoppable force. He started out strong and then petered out



* Many action scenes felt messy and blurry and lacked what made those scenes great in the first Avengers. The intro scene was somewhat ok. 

In the end the worst thing about Age of Ultron was that it was souless. It has a few cool things like Vision and world building but viewed on it's own its just a weak movie. It's very sad because I think Whedon can make great movies with wonderful characters and plot, I can only guess that bureaucracy and constraints got the best of him here.

Then again, Whedon's job is not to make the Citizen Kane of super hero movies, but make the highest grossing movie for Marvel and maybe teenagers will love it, from much of the reviews so far I seem to be in the minority :) Maybe a darker movie would have been more appreciated by  critics and less so by a young audience.

- The Vision was fantastic, everything I would have hoped for.  He looks amazing, the detail they added was sharp.  He's got normal eyeballs, which I guess adds the more humanity to him &amp; looks better in a live-action movie, but I would have liked if his eyes had a more robotic look to them.  Assuming they follow through with Vision getting together romantically with the Scarlet Witch, I guess they'll need him to appear to have a soul.  His phase-through-the-chest-and-solidify move was in the movie, as was his eye-beams; I was hoping he'd get his cape somehow, &amp; they had a neat little moment to make that happen; he moved great, spoke well (glad he clarified that he's not Ultron's offspring nor Jarvis, but his own thing), &amp; generally added something new &amp; exciting to the team.  I don't agree that his appearance eliminated any tension because he was so powerful, it made things more fun &amp; exciting for me.  Another Marvel comics favorite brought to life in this movie, awesome job.

- Quicksilver &amp; the Scarlet Witch started off a little shaky for me, but I warmed up to them, as the movie did not leave any character behind for long.  It's a shame that Quicksilver was killed, but it added some drama &amp; they disposed of a character that Fox's X-Men got to first.  By the last third of the movie, I'd warmed up to Scarlet Witch enough that I was really enjoying watching her kick some ass.  Her powers are mysterious, as it should be.

- Ultron was about as good as I could have hoped for a maniacal robot in a movie.  He's a prime Avengers villain, &amp; he was beaten a little more easily than I would have thought, but he made basically two full teams of Avengers as enemies by the end, it would have been a stretch to have him hold up for long with that much brute force pounding away.  His army of robots caused a little deja-vu to the first Avengers movie, but it fit &amp; was true enough to the comics.  Spader was good, I just never thought of Ultron as having a sense of humor or irony, or being much for conversational tone.  

- The original team all got a respectable amount of time &amp; focus for their professional &amp; personal character activities, no small feat.  I didn't see Hawkeye's Homestead visit as an ""out"" for his character to leave the team, but I get it now.  Natasha having a romance with Banner was unexpected, I'd prefer if anyone on the team kept themselves just a little cold &amp; unavailable, it be her, but she functions as a handler for Hulk, so I'll go along...my time reading the Avengers comic book never included the Hulk, he was with The Defenders, a much looser team that would take on some pretty volatile ""heroes"", so I guess they have to have something in place to control Hulk, who better than Natasha?

- I love what they've done with Captain America, he's a character I could never bring myself to dislike in the comics despite being corny on the surface, &amp; they've taken that a step further in the movies.  He kicked ass in AoU, his one-on-one with Ultron was noteworthy for a few reasons.  He's given more humor in this movie, &amp; is mostly adjusted to his new life, &amp; I think I'm rooting for him more than any other character, even though Thor was my favorite from the comics. 

- The teamwork the characters use in the movie puts the X-Men movies to shame.  The X-Men's Danger Room is the breeding ground for a special camaraderie, trust, knowledge of teammates' abilities, &amp; it's never been used with any effort in the movie franchise.  The Avengers are shown doing all of these things in a fun, spontaneous way without any kind of exposition or training montage.   I really like that they're a team on different levels, &amp; it reminded me of my frustration &amp; disappointment with Fox / Singer's X-Men movies, which go out of their way to feature Xavier, Magneto, &amp; Wolverine, at the expense of so much else that was great about the comics.  

- The new Avengers took me by surprise, I should have seen it coming.  It's true to the comics &amp; part of what was great about it, the team had crazy turnover &amp; it works for the movie franchise.  As sad as I am to see Thor &amp; Iron Man go, adding Vision &amp; Scarlet Witch was an exciting trade.  What a great way to end the movie.

- Vision was awesome and picking up the hammer was unexpectly perfect.

- Enjoyed all the cameos, more War Machine and Falcon is always great. Also noticed the SHIELD tech from Winter Soldier that refuses to launch the helicarriers is working with SHIELD again!

- Action was intense, lots of badass sequences. Really liked the Hulkbuster scene.

- Characters were shaken up, it's good for them to be dynamic and go on interesting new paths at the end.

- Full 180 on Hawkeye, from zombie to interesting and likable. Again, unexpected but in a good way with the whole family thing.

- Loved all the visions/nightmares for the characters, I wish they would have lasted longer though.


Cons:

- I love a good snarky quip, but I swear this film was 70% quips. It was quip overload. It needed more solid, straightforward dialogue like Winter Soldier. The quips are better when they're unique and spaced out.

- Ultron looked cool, sounded cool ... but didn't really sell me on being a villain. I find the whole ""I'm saving the world by destroying it"" very trite and lackluster. I think him wanting to defeat the Avengers because he thinks they're not good enough to protect the world would make more sense.

- I'm still disappointed they didn't reference Agents of SHIELD. They EASILY could have slipped in a wink and a nod without alienating the audience. Lord knows they made lots of references that depend on virtually every previous film.",,1430457504,0,t3_34h0or,

I'll admit I'm getting a little bored of comic movies espcially marvel. I loved the first two acts of winter solider and guardians. But the 3rd act both seemed to need to check off ""epic end battle scene where you don't really feel like anyone is in danger"" 

I saw the showing with the first movie back to back. That movie after half a dozen viewings still feels alive an exciting to me. I don't need to break it down into parts it just makes me ""feel"" something. It's why I love films for how they bring out some emotion in you. Age of ultron made me feel nothing. I just felt ""there"".  All the coolest parts like the hulk buster fight just didn't excite me much. Maybe it's because I didn't connect with the story or villain or style... I can't put my finger on it. 

I still can watch Star Wars after 200 times and feel excited when Luke is going down the Death Star trench which is why I'll always love that movie. I still feel excited in la confideitial when the strands of plot come together even though I know the outcome. I still feel excited in 2001, pulp fiction, shawshanke... Etc. I'm not trying to compare  just saying I felt nothing out of this movie and honestly doubt I'll bother seeing it again on Blu ray which is a shame because I was so excited.

I liked it because it was fun, witty banter, snarky  villain, and the team just works well together*. Hawkeyes bigger role was done well and really helped his character. Banner and widow was fun i thought, but a bit... rushed. Vision was great but came off underpowered, same with scarlet witch (one of the most powerful  beings in marvel universe to 'eh she is kinda psychic' - and no mention that this is like... a bug deal in the MCU to be psychic, SHEILD TV show kept saying how impossible it was). Liked Fury's return. Good gauntlet hints. 

What I didn't like - this felt like a side story. Like an oh shit  whoops- a 2 hour excuse to introduce vision and change out the cast before civil war and A3. Ultron  just simply should have been bigger than he was made to be. As it stands I felt the movie didn't add much to any end goal. Just kinda... filler. 

The movie felt rushed. There were weird cuts that seems to skip chunks of time in an awkward way - as if scenes got chopped and there just wasn't footage to fit the cut. The there was TOO much for the time - too many things happening so fast non stop - the movie needed some better down time with some narative. Sounds weird to say a long movie felt short, but it did feel rushed. . 

There wasn't a sense of danger. Straight up, the whole meteor thing didn't feel nearly as menacing as a worm hole spitting out alien invaders above new york. But it SHOULD  have - Ultron is serious shit. 

Ugh. I had fun, it was entertaining. The action was good. The dialogue was witty and funny. But it was just a bit flat on its overall execution. If avengers was a 9/10, this was a 7.5/10. Still fun. Still worth the ticket price. I'm seeing it again Saturday. It was good, It just wasn't *great*.

The pace is quickly established in these first few moments, and the film rarely lets off the throttle until the end credits, resulting in an experience that is exhausting in the best way possible.

Balancing screen time for such an enormous cast of characters is a tall order, but Age of Ultron fares far better than the original film at giving everyone their moment in the spotlight. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was noticeably short-changed in The Avengers, but this time around he plays a pivotal role that serves as the emotional centerpiece of the narrative. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) also steps into the forefront, with some haunting glimpses into her past and a poignant depiction of her vulnerability.

Of course, it? the newcomers who everyone will be talking about. Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his twin sister, Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) bring an entirely different perspective on how the disenfranchised can be affected by those who wield all the power ?and speaking of powers, they?e got some of those, too. The character of Pietro has already appeared onscreen in X-Men: Days of Future Past, but it? easy to argue that this darker depiction carries significantly more emotional weight, and Wanda? abilities are the stuff of nightmares ?literally.

But it? Ultron himself who has the most commanding presence, with his massive robotic frame towering over his human counterparts, and his chilling metallic voice sending shivers down the spines of moviegoers. Spader is perfectly cast as the gleaming villain, infusing a perfect blend of humor and intellgience into the performance to create arguably the most fascinating Marvel antagonist yet.

Avengers: Age of Ultron isn? without its problems, however. The creation of Ultron is glossed over a bit too quickly, feeling contrived even for a superhero film, and there are so many major action sequences that the audience barely has time to appreciate the spectacle before we?e barreling right along to the next one. But honestly, these are mere quibbles ?Age of Ultron is a superhero sequel that improves on its predecessor in all the right ways, and continues Marvel? standard of cinematic excellence.",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

I was pretty excited for the MCU and how it would turn out, but this movie disappointed me in so many ways that I'm beginning to realize I've already seen everything they have to offer. This movie had a chance to expand build up to the rest of phase 3, but instead wraps up a neat little mediocre villain episode in a couple of hours and now we're moving on to whatever bullshit we pay for next. 

There were so many opportunities for development there were just thrown away. The next big story arc is supposed to be Civil War, and by the end of Ultron all the conflict between the team is forgotten, and everyone becomes pals again because that's what's supposed to happen? 

The whole reason Ultron is created, Tony's fear of letting everyone down, is not dealt with whatsoever. He created Ultron, his evil mirror image, and never actually confronts him, just a half assed 2 minute battle before we move on to the next one. There is no satisfying resolution for Tony. Not to mention that there are no repercussions for Tony shoving artificial intelligence into machines... twice. Two wrongs do make a right? 

Someone on the last AoU thread said that Marvel seems to think high stakes means *the end of the world!* But it doesn't. I never once felt worried about someone, the Iron Legion was unbelievably weak and effortless to defeat, and Ultron himself lost any of the menace he had in the trailers, and quickly followed the artificial intelligence tropes that we've already seen. 
And in a movie called **AGE** of Ultron, the whole series of events lasted maybe a week? 

The pacing was weird, we go from ""everything is peachy"" to ""the end of the world is at stake"" in about two scenes? Ultron's creation also happened instantaneously, and right away he had plans to destroy the world, no time to reflect upon his birth and his peace keeping mission, just no fuck that. It would been interesting to see Ultron actually give peace keeping a try only to realize it makes no logical sense. Instead we get unbearably cringe worthy dialogue between Bruce Banner and Natasha, I won't even attempt to describe everything wrong with that shit show. 

So many things happen out of fucking nowhere.
 
* Nick Fury and the helicarrier. 

* Jarvis just reappears magically.

* Bruce Banner literally just walks into Ultron's hideout to free Natasha. 

* Thor's vision.

And even the things that worked, killing Quicksilver, Hulk escaping, giving some back story and development to characters, was ultimately wasted because of the standalone nature of this movie. I could have skipped Age of Ultron completely and not have missed a thing. You could go back to the first Avenger's movie, copy and paste a picture of Ultron over Loki and it would be practically the same movie. And if this is all that it takes to satisfy audiences, I would not like to be a part of that audience anymore.

*rant over*

I'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.

There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.

Tony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? They don't even try to explain his return. Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. These movies always just seem to be about ""setting something up"" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. All those previous movies build to this?

Age of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. I just didn't care. There's no stakes in the action. When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie.

Marvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. You can be serious without being all ""dark and gritty"" too. Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. Joss Whedon failed.",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

Lot of weird pointless action scenes with countless enemy minions trying to stop the villain from doing something that will end the world that the villain succeeds at but still gets his ass kicked by The Avengers.

I guess I'm finding the DC universe much more compelling. They seem to have the guts to take their themes and ideas seriously. Marvel can't decide if they're light hearted or serious so do a bad mix of both. 

Movie looked fantastic though I did notice a few instances where it looked really fake. Scarlett Witch was very well done. There was no reason to kill Quicksilver except to be ""dramatic"" and bring him back to life later which we all know is happening. I don't get how Hawkeye can fight killer robots who fly at the speed of sound with a bow and arrow without dying immediately. 

Black Widow Banner romance seemed shoehorned and rushed. Kind of a shame turning her into another needy woman chasing an unavailable and aloof man. 

Besides Civil War and GOTG 2, I would bet none of the future Marvel will be good.  It's a formula at this point. And the twenty minute product placement shots were ridiculous. ",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

Long rant about this film's potential incoming. Disclaimer: I liked it. I don't think it was as good as Avengers 1, but it was a pretty solid film. I'm currently hoping the Avengers series follows the Iron Man trilogy where the first one's good, the second one's weaker, and the third one is arguably the strongest.

So anyway, biggest complaint with the film was the theme. I can't really identify a theme. It's part ""we aren't really a perfect team yet"", part ""we create what we dread, ie Ultron"". Now not only do neither of these themes work great on their own, but they don't really work in tandem, and neither's a great theme for the sequel to a film with the theme ""Learning to work together"". A great theme could have been ""Is the world actually better off without us? Should we have teamed up in the first place?"" Maybe it's just me, but I think a darker theme about whether or not the heroes make the world a better place would have made for a better sequel.

Next complaint, Ultron. [As /u/tmbcake13 put it](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/34h0or/official_discussion_the_avengers_age_of_ultron_us/cqum3i2) he's way too all over the place. I really liked the Ultron we see in the [teaser trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeOjFno6Do) A really dark villain who reads all of the Avengers' files and uses that information to make them doubt themselves. The whole ""puppets tangled in strings"" thing could have been a great way to set up a whole ""you sacrificed individuality, the things that make you who you are, to become a team"" arc. The team learned to work together, now they have to learn not to rely on each other. Cap isn't always gonna be there to hold his shield so Thor can whack it and do... whatever that did. Hulk's not always gonna have Black Widow to calm him down. [Spoiler](#s ""Scarlet Witch isn't always gonna have Quicksilver, and when she loses him she's already learned the lesson the others learned, earning her an invite to a permanent slot on the team."") Maybe that's just what I would have wanted, but I feel like there are a lot of moments in the film that set up perfectly for this. Maybe Hawkeye's wife tells him he's changed, he's exactly like his teammates. Maybe Scarlet Witch shows them their worst fears and they all notice they're each reacting the same way, sans Hawkeye who didn't get nightmared. Maybe Hawkeye gets some character development by being forced to hold the team together, as opposed to having a family and being snarkier. Maybe Quicksilver tries to fit in by mimicking the team and they they're not as quick to accept him. Maybe we get an actual sequel instead of a slightly different version of the first film.

tl;dr: No theme and a villain with unfulfilled potential yield a disappointing sequel.",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

Overused camera movements and short cuts in editing makes some action scenes unwatchable, and I think it would make more sense to spend some good time in developing character arcs instead of useless fighting scenes.

As usual, charisma of Robert Downey jr. saved the show, and it is not so bad from rest of the cast, especially good chemistry between Evans, Renner and Ruffalo. It was cute choice of Taylor Johnson and great catch phrase ""you did't expect that"" and script-wise it was good use and buildup of Hammer joke, audience exploded. The biggest problem is meaningless script, far less developed then comic scripts of the source. Stan Lee would make a better job in schooling those Hollywood youngsters how to write solid story instead of that insulting cammeo with untalented Thor cast.

I would have thought at least they would do something with that to set up Civil War. I guess there's a new Avengers team, but this series already has enough characters as it is.

I don't know why, but nothing in this film got me excited or engaged me like other Marvel films have. Hulk vs Iron Man wasn't too memorable, the shifting tones of Ultron led to me not taking him seriously, Quicksilver's death didn't feel like it will have any bearing on other films, Banner/Romanov romantic relationship felt forced and unnecessary.

AoU had the same old predictable Marvel plot, had no tension and very little sense of consequence. In the grand scheme of things, nothing really happened.

It knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything other than a super hero free for all (looking at you Winter Soldier). They basically took that one long shot of them all fighting as a team in  the last movie and extended it to over two hours. 

It may be indulgent but it doesn't stop it from being exhilarating to watch, the team come together. You could quite easily watch these characters going away for a weekend away in a cabin in the woods and it would probably still be enjoyable.   

I think Marvel has made better movies, Guardians of the Galaxy is still my favourite, closely followed by Iron Man 3 and Ultron is no substitute for Loki. It doesn't really move the Marvel universe on, compared to previous movies but the dialogue and set pieces sizzle along enjoyably.

When it boils down to it, the movie is about people in spandex fighting robots. You can relax a bit on it.

I thought it was a fun popcorn flick. The storyline, I feel like, is kinda convoluted for someone not super aware of the comics, but it's still interesting and you can follow it. The comedy in it really works. The acting in it is more than serviceable. Some of the shots and action sequences in it are gorgeous. It visually looks amazing.

First I want to say that if you loved the film and had fun watching it then I'm really freaking happy for you, I wanted to like this movie so much it is probably the most excited I have been for a movie in a long time.

Avengers 2: Age of Ultron is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. I've never been more let down by a film more than this one, and that of course is my own fault. I shrugged off any reviews that weren't positive of it thinking 'THIS IS THE AVENGERS!' how could I not like it? I saw the movie at 7 last night with two friends and my younger sister. I'm the largest nerd of the four of us, and honestly I'm a borderline Marvel fanboy. I started out reading DC when I was young and Ultimate Spider-Man was the series that really got me into comics. Over time my DC reading has started to dwindle and I've fallen in love with Marvel. That extends to the movies, even when they were lackluster I was left still grinning like a fool and loving every moment of it.

My legs were bouncing in anticipation waiting for the movie to start as local ads were being run, we hadn't even gotten to the trailers yet. The theater was packed full of people all brimming with excitement for Avengers 2. I'd been counting down the days to see this movie for months. The ads for it playing during Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were almost excruciating.

It was about half an hour in that I realized I wasn't enjoying the movie at all. I couldn't even shut my brain off and let it be fun, instead my brain was critiquing every moment of it, I was most entertained by the kid behind me apparently mad that his mother was putting her fingers in his mouth.

People often talk of Bendis speak, where every character sounds the same and has the same snappy writing. Well I think Whedon and Bendis are very much alike. If Spider-Man had been in this film it wouldn't have mattered, he wouldn't have been anything special because everyone was constantly throwing off a snarky line. It got to the point where they couldn't go more than a minute or two in some scenes before throwing out some joke. A lot of the times it felt like they were just scrapping the bottom of the barrel. I wondered if maybe something had happened to make the characters borderline psychopaths. They couldn't go more than a moment without cracking a joke as people are dying around them.

The action scenes were very lackluster. I don't know that there wasn't a single action scene in the movie that wasn't at least 70% CGI. After the last three things put out by Marvel being absolutely fantastic and having great battles I had huge expectations. Guardians, Daredevil, Winter Soldier all had amazing fight scenes and in this we were relegated to stuff that didn't look that believable as it was all CGI. There were a few noteworthy scenes that involved Cap and his shield.

Jokes were made by the group I was with, who all also disliked the movie, that Hawkeye was the only good thing about this movie and that there was no way that Joss Whedon wrote him. A conspiracy was concocted that Jedd wrote those parts and that was why they were truly so good.

The stand out for this movie was Hakweye actually getting some character. The agreed upon two scenes from the movie that we all liked was the initial hammer scene and the moment shared between Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Moments where everyone didn't need to be a comedian every minute, where character could actually be shown and leaked through. These scenes also managed to actually be funny without overdoing it.

My thoughts are a bit disjointed and all over the place as I leap all over the movie. I wanted to sleep upon it so that I could be less negative than I was feeling last night.

Quicksilver was an absolute waist. I knew going into the movie he would die as an asshole spoiled it on the Marvel subreddit. I kept looking out for things that would make it meaningful and have me care that this was going to happen. Instead we didn't get much in the way of any actual character for Quicksilver. He did manage to give some legitimately funny scenes but besides that he didn't actually have much to him. Why should I care that he died? It just felt hollow.

I think one of my biggest dislikes in this movie is Tony. He is the worst with the one liners that are scrapping the bottom of the barrel, there are times where it felt like Robert was even laughing at how bad the lines or dialogue was. My god the dialogue was terrible in places. We got such cliched lines as ""What doesn't kill you makes you strong"" and ""You aren't the only monster."" There were many groan worthy lines.

Black Widow was virtually ruined. I honestly don't think that Joss watched a single one of the movies that came after Avengers. He wanted to do whatever he wanted and since the first movie made a shitload of money Marvel let him. Anything that happened in the past movies was pretty much glossed over and ignored. Gone was the assassin who had been scarred in fights and who could kick ass. Instead she was replaced with an emotional mess who was gushing after Bruce the entire movie. Also what the fuck was up with that? In the first movie there was allusion that Natasha and Clint were a thing. They even made a note of focusing upon the Arrow necklace that she wore throughout the entirety of Captain America 2. Instead he has a secret hidden family that she has known about and she wants Bruce.

Fury showing up last minute, or at all for that matter was also infuriating. At the end of Winter Soldier he discards his eye patch and makes note that he is going to go upon his vacation and lay low for a while. Coulson is then made Director of SHIELD. Nah forget all of that Fury is back and he has SHIELD and a Hellicarier again. We are just going to gloss over the entire TV show and Winter Soldiers because we feel like it.

Thor...god Thor was such a mess. For some reason despite everyone else just getting visions from the Scarlet Witch messing with their minds he gets flashes of the Infinity Stones so that he can act as a walking exposition dump. He goes off to find the professor and go to the cave for...reasons? We don't really get a great explanation of what is going on, in general there isn't much great explanations as to what is actually happening. Instead we gets jokes.

So we have the scene in Korea with the flying trailer which was alright but then we have probably the most out of character moment ever. Captain America the guy who is supposed to inspire hope on Superman levels is dreary throughout parts of this movie, constantly bringing up how they will die. Natasha is kidnapped and he repeatedly tells Clint to just leave her, who cares right? He would NEVER just leave someone behind like that. They made no note of him or the twins looking for her at all.

So moving on we end up with the scene where everyone converges back on Avengers Tower. No one really knows how Cap, Quicksilver, and Wanda all got back as Clint left with their jet. Thor shows up, how he knew they were there no ones knows, to literally give the Frankenstein bolt of lightning to bring Vision to life.

Vision doesn't make a lot of sense to me. His body was created and we saw that I believe like 80% of Ultron was downloaded into hos body. Tony and Bruce are trying to put Jarvis into the body yet before they can Quicksilver disconnects everything, yet still when he awakes he has Jarvis' voice and thought process?

Thor of course gets into his info dumping stage. He shows up to explain the Infinity Stones for those who didn't watch Guardians of the Galaxy except a giant mistake is made. Then we get a montage of everyone quickly getting ready and some last minute product placement!

I really don't want to continue anymore as I don't really have any more positive things to say. I would give this movie a 6/10 and it is without a doubt my least favorite movie in the MCU. I like both the Thor movies more than Avengers 2...I never thought I would think or feel that.",,0,0,t3_34h0or,

* The hand movements by the Witch as she's implanting thoughts was so incredibly cheesy and lame.. ""ooh i'm casting a spell"".  Why in other scenes does she barely have to move her hands to do anything and other times she has to go through demonstrative movements.. 

*  Ok, so the Hulk destroys a city, and another city is lifted off the ground and explodes all because of one man's actions and nobody cares or dies?  I realize its a comics movie, but come on.. It felt like just wasting time with endless destruction similar to the last half of Man Of Steel

*  The scene where they are fighting together in a circle was the best part of the movie.  It truly felt like a comic panel came alive

*  Oooh Ultron is in the internet.. he could be anywhere.. watch out Redditor's he could be in your 'puters

*  It was great seeing Vision, but how he was created and came to be didn't have any real explanation.. Did the mind-stone create him, or is the mind-stone him, or does he need it to be 'alive'

*  Scarlet Witch could have used a better costume at the end.. Maybe Elizabeth Olsen didn't have the figure for it but something similar to the Black Widow outfit in a brighter red at least.

*  ""Tasha"" is sort for Natasha.. not ""Nat"".. and why at the end of the movie is all of a sudden everyone calling her ""Nat"" instead of just saying ""Widow"".

*  Whedon dialogue , you know it going in, just have to expect it.  ""I totally support your avenging.."" .. worst line in the movie.

I love that Hawkeye got more screen time, but why did they have to go with ultimate!Hawkeye? I love 616 Hawkeye so much and was looking forward to seeing more of his train wreck of a life on screen. I think they still did a good job with his sense of humor, though and I thoroughly enjoyed every second he got on screen. 

Vision was perfect. Him picking up Mjolnir was the highlight for me and I love the little nod to his relationship with Wanda when he's the one who saves her at the end. Wanda was also pretty badass! And I loved the touch of the twins' accents.

Black Widow back story, finally! But that's about all I liked about BW in this movie and it's SO DISAPPOINTING. She's my absolute favorite character and they reduced her in this film to being the person designated to calm down the Hulk (that whole romance seemed so forced, too) and get herself captured so Hulk could have a reason to get back into the battle. When you compare her involvement in this movie to Avengers #1 and Cap #2 then you can see how they didn't bother to give her anything to work with.

Overall I thought the movie was enjoyable but I left a bit underwhelmed. The opening fight was not well done in my opinion and that stumble out the gate didn't serve the rest of the movie at all. Some of the CGI was a little too fake looking, those few moments where the action pauses and the audience gets a slow shot of a comic book like still was cool in theory but poorly executed.

Honestly none of the action scenes were that great, there were some cool parts (I personally liked some of the team-up attacks like when Cap angles his shield and Thor strikes it causing a blast wave in the direction of a bunch of bad guys) but for the most part the action never really felt...epic?

Ultron was a decent villain, the way James Spader voiced him worked really well, the character comes off as equal parts menacing and human at the same time. With that said once Vision enters the movie Ultron is essentially a minor threat given how much more powerful Vision is. The movie would have been far better served by leaving Vision out until the very end to come to the rescue. 

The love story between Bruce Banner and Black Widow was something that felt a bit forced. Without any real build up to it I had a hard time caring and when Banner leaves at the end I really didn't care. 

Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time and I actually felt that he was one of the strongest parts of the movie. 

There was some good humor in the movie as we've come to expect from these films, that I will say is one part that the film did well.

Overall I enjoyed the film as I said earlier but I wasn't knocked out of my seat by any means. If you're a Marvel fan you're probably going to see this and for the 2ish hours that the movie lasts you will be entertained but I don't think you'll be blown away.

In conclusion, my tought was: 

Things done right:

- The action is just espectacular, even more when avengers fought as a team. The hulk x hulkbuster scene was great along with the first fight in the woods, in the beggining of the movie.

- Ultron personality was fun to watch, some funny comic bits and scenes.

- It was nice seeing captain more as a leader and kicking a lot more ass than in the first movie. I think its cool that you can really see him developing his skills through out the movies. 

- Hawkeye was really good in this movie, I liked that they showed he knows his place but still can make a huge difference in the team. I really liked his comic bits too, probably the funniest scenes in the movie have him involved.

- The end scene with the ''New Avengers'' was pretty cool, that felt really right.

- Vision was just spot on. Every single scene with him was just great!

- The movie felt like it didnt add much to the storyline as a whole, I think that it should had focus more on explaining the power and importance of the infinity stones as a whole to the MCU, people that dont remember much of the previous movies or didnt watch them still have no clue/dont care what a infinity stone is. 

- For a movie called ''the AGE of Ultron'' it felt to me like Ultron was really easilly defeated and all the story in the movie felt like it happend way too fast. As I said before  things happened with no build up to it, they just ''happened''. I think the pacing in this movie in general wasnt so great, storywise.

- I missed a more manecing and dark Ultron. He felt more like a spoiled child than a dark enemy, he just didnt ''scare'' me at all. I tought he was really gonna give a tough time to some of the avengers, I felt like in NO moment I was at the edge of my seat thinking ''Holy shit, he's gonna kill him/her (add any of the avengers). I just never tought any of the Avengers where actually IN DANGER anytime through the entire movie. I felt that sometimes with Loki in the first movie (first fight with Cap, killing Coulson, almost killing Thor and stabbing him bad, almost killing Tony at the tower, etc)

- This bothered me so much: Tony puts the whole world in danger with his stupid ''I wanna be a mad scientist'' moment and by the end he has nothing to respond for? Even if no one actually acuse him of anything, he doesnt seem to care or take responsability for anything he did, by the end of the movie everyone is fine with what happend (even tough probably thousands of civilian lifes were taken) and the end felt like nothing really happened, that felt so cheesy and weird to me. It was the perfect situation to adress a struggle between Cap x Tony and maybe give a glimpse of what Civil War might feel and they just seem like best buds by the end of the movie. No one care about anything that happend!

- The romance between Natasha and Banner was really forced and out of place. It just happened out of nowhere and Natasha who was introduced as a cold hearted spy is now acting like a sentimental teenager. It just didnt work for me, it was just weird.

- Honestly Nick Fury has no place in this movie other than conveniently showing with a Hellicarrier by the end of it, one more example to me of things that just ''happen'' with no build up to it. I really like his character but it felt like he was just squeezed in this movie for the sake of it.

- I really didnt like Thor in this movie, he had such a high place in the first Avengers and now he just felt to me like a secondary character in this movie, the character really lacked emotion. And what the hell was that scene with Selvig, what was that lake that gave him a ''vision'' of things, what were his visions? Why he needed Selvig for with him? One more thing that just ''happend''

- So basically at the end of the movie it seems like Hawkeye and Ironman just dropped out of the Avengers? I think that was really unclear but it felt like they did. And if they did, shouldnt it feel like it was more of a big deal than what they showed? For me it just felt like ''So, Tony and Barton maybe are out, whatever, who cares''. It should be a big deal!

Well these are my toughts, fun movie with great action, but the story and character emotions felt a little flat to me. 7 ou of 10.

I was also worried the funny lines might be forced but I genuinely enjoyed the humor and the plot was great for the sophomore effort. Oh and the scattered plot elements for the next films got our whole crowd pumped.

I liked the new characters though and Vision was badass. Was hoping for a more epic intro but I guess Thor jumping on him and sparking him to life will do.

Bunch of awesome one-liners but i think my favorite was Stark's "" you guys aren't playing hide the green zuchinni are you?"" lol. i'm suprised they kept that in there.

&gt; Yes, he is 35 years older than Mirabelle (Claire Danes), but we're not talking marriage here, we're talking about a relationship based on shared assumptions and friendly sex, plus a lot of Ray Porter's money, which he is spending not to purchase Mirabelle but simply to provide himself with a woman who dresses, dines and travels up to his standards.

If a relationship is treated like a business transaction it's only so long before the deal is done and both parties go separate ways.

I feel indifferent about the film.  Jeremy's character or the way Jason plays him is too flighty/jittery for me.  If we're talking about picking between two bachelors and which one gave her the emotional support, yeah, it's Jeremy.  But I felt even then he didn't really rise to the occasion.  Of course, neither did Ray.  His nature seemed purely monetary.  It makes sense that he feels if he can purchase things he can feel better about himself.  You just can't purchase people.

Mirabelle is an object of desire for the two men who don't appear to have much regard for what she wants, and truthfully she seemed to have little regard for it. Sort of a non-manic pixie dream girl. She exists only to define the men, primarily Ray.

Again, I wasn't completely focused on it, but it's not like it drew me in either.

&gt; People suffer largely unnoticed while the rest of the world goes about its business. This is a documentary exploration of the mythic beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge, the most popular suicide destination in the world, and those drawn by its call. Steel and his crew filmed the bridge during daylight hours from two separate locations for all of 2004, recording most of the two dozen deaths in that year (and preventing several others). They also taped interviews with friends, families and witnesses, who recount in sorrowful detail stories of struggles with depression, substance abuse and mental illness. Raises questions about suicide, mental illness and civic responsibility as well as the filmmaker's relationship to his fraught and complicated material.

&gt; Sullivan is a successful, spoiled, and naive director of fluff films, with a heart-o-gold, who decides he wants to make a film about the troubles of the downtrodden poor. Much to the chagrin of his producers, he sets off in tramp's clothing with a single dime in his pocket to experience poverty first-hand, and gets some reality shock.

&gt; Fredrick ""Fred"" Jones, Jr., Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers, and Scooby-Doo make up the team of teenage mystery solvers who live in a small town called Crystal Cove, the self-proclaimed ""Most Hauntedest Place on Earth"". The town's long history of strange disappearances and ghost and monster sightings form the basis for its thriving tourist industry, and as such, the gang's parents and some people (mostly Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that their children are debunking all the supernatural goings-on that bring in so much revenue as the overwrought schemes of charlatans and criminals. In addition to the traditional cases they always solve, the team finds itself being nudged into the uncovering of a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove, covered up by parties unknown. The new Mystery Incorporated is following cryptic hints from a faceless mystery-man known only as ""Mr. E"". The new Mystery Incorporated is unearthing the legend of a cursed Conquistador treasure, the secret history of Crystal Cove's founding Darrow Family, and the mysterious, unsolved case involving four mystery-solving youths and their pet-the original Mystery Incorporated. Standing in the way of their solving this mystery, however, are the romantic entanglements pulling the kids apart\: Shaggy finds himself unable to put his new romance with Velma ahead of his longtime friendship with Scooby, while Daphne pines for a trap-obsessed Fred, who obliviously struggles to realize he shares her feelings too. As they investigate further the mystery about the curse of Crystal Cove, they discover that a creature known as ""The Freak of Crystal Cove"" threatens and stalks anyone who comes near the haunted treasure. They uncover the Freak's true identity to be Mayor Fred Jones Sr. who reveals that Fred's true parents are Brad and Judy from the original Mystery, Inc. In the aftermath, Fred goes off to find his real parents and breaks his engagement with Daphne, declaring that ""Mystery, Inc. is dead"". Shaggy's parents send Shaggy to a military academy and Scooby-Doo to a farm. As Professor Pericles flaunts his two pieces of the Planospheric Disc, Scooby-Doo vows to get the gang back together and go after him.

So he writes a story where he's a cold, lonely psychopath that kicks people's asses, drives like a badass, and who has to protect the girl he loves from the bad guys. It feels more like an adolescent power fantasy than any superhero movie I've ever seen.

It also just felt really tedious to me. I really did want to like it, but after a while I just found it funny. It seemed like a parody of itself to. A lot of people refer to it as an art house film for some reason. It isn't. It just feels like an art house film sometimes because of the beautiful cinematography. It's not an art house film. It's a very, very mediocre action film. It really belongs in the same conversation as movies like The Boondocks Saints. 

It doesn't at all surprise me that it has a huge following among young men who probably also like Christopher Nolan a little too much. ",,1430459917,1,t3_34hk3w,

The pacing.

Yes it's 'slow' but for me it just builds this tension without ever really getting relief.  And then when the tension finally is released its a fast explosion of violence like the snapping of a million rubber bands.

The visuals.

I picked up on some of what Refn was doing but Tony Zhou's ""Drive - Quadrant System"" video for his YouTube channel ""Every Frame a Painting"" really breaks down what Refn was doing.

http://youtu.be/wsI8UES59TM

Finally, the cast.  Everyone in the film is amazing.  The cast is incredible and delivers really quiet but powerful performances.

Of course everyone isn't going to love it.

But if you're only 20 minutes in I say watch the Every Frame is a Painting video and if you like that restart the film and watch it all the way through.",,0,0,t3_34hk3w,

As for general discussion, **Spoilers** -- My favorite scene is Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) last day as a wise guy. One reason, it's the climax of the cocaine energy that the film carries. The scene starts with a title scene, ""Sunday May 11th, 1980 6:55AM"", then bam, a line of coke, that's how the day starts. As Henry gets deeper and deeper into cocaine and the gangster lifestyle, the pace of the film parallels that. We literally see through the eyes of a sleep deprived coke head  -- quick cuts, fast panning and zooming. 

Another reason why I love it, while on the surface, the audience feels just as paranoid and worried as Henry, with the helicopter, selling the guns, managing the cocaine to go to Atlanta. The juxtaposition of Henry also preparing for dinner gives a layer of humor. But when we get so close to the finish line, Lois asks to go back home for her hat. You literally can't believe it yourself, after all that juggling and managing, she throws this on you. You feel angry in one view, in other viewing, you find it funny. ",,0,0,t3_34holy,

&gt; Edward is a rich, ruthless businessman who specializes in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece. He travels to Los Angeles for a business trip and decides to hire a prostitute. They take a liking to each other and he offers her money if she'll stay with him for an entire week while he makes the ""rich and famous"" scene (since it doesn't do for a man of his stature to be alone at society parties and polo matches). Romantic comedy (and complications) ensue.

Furious 7 follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesties in Fast &amp; Furious 6 for their past crimes, until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts them in danger once again.

&gt; In Los Angeles, a gang of armed thieves is hitting serious targets - major banks, vaults, and armored cars. These thieves are led by arch-criminal Neal MacAuley. One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank...
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Heat was well received by critics. The film-critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 86% positive reviews based on 76 reviews, summarizing the film as ""an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars ?and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre."" Metacritic gives the film a score of 76 based on 22 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3?stars out of 4, writing\: ""It's not just an action picture. Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking\: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with cliches. Of the many imprisonments possible in our world, one of the worst must be to be inarticulate ?to be unable to tell another person what you really feel."" Simon Cote of The Austin Chronicle called the film ""\[o\]ne of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years"", and said Pacino and De Niro's scenes together were ""poignant and gripping"".

Sounds insane, right? The movie sub doesn't allow links to the largest movie site on the internet? Here's why- nearly all of the user imdb submissions are announcements to films or trivia, and neither are credible from imdb. Projects get shifted around way too much on imdb, and the trivia ranges from baseless fan-fiction to gossipy drama. If your submission is trivia or a film announcement, please find an article about the film somewhere else and submit that. If you're recommending a film, please link to its trailer on youtube. If your submission falls outside of these categories, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmovies) and we'll put this submission back. Thanks for your patience.

Scene 2: Some guy lighting up a cigar.  Man that cigar looks good.  I wish I could get one like it

Scene 3: Very Shallow political analysis.  Weirdly, this section showed untranslated footage of Haile Selassie of Rastafarian fame giving a speech at the League of Nations protesting the use of chemical weapons in Africa.  But, he is portrayed as some weirdo, speaking some unintelligible language, babbling about some crap nobody could possibly care about, calling him pathetically ""The loneliest man at the League of Nations."" A kind of joke.

Scene 4:  Some high tech trains catering to the tourist dollar.

&gt; In a faraway land called Duloc, a heartless ruler, the diminutive Lord Farquaad, has banished all the fairy tale beings from the land so it can be as boring as he is. But there are three characters who will stand in his way. The first is a green, smelly ogre with a heart of gold named Shrek, his faithful steed, Donkey, who will do anything but shut up, and the beautiful but tough Princess Fiona whom Lord Farquaad wishes to make his wife so he can become king of Duloc. What's to do in a screwy fairy tale like this?

Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 190 reviews, with an average score of 7\.7\/10\. The critical consensus is\: ""While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney's nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.""

It helps having seen X3 when you see The Wolverine. Also X3 is not hard to watch if you turn the ""comic fan"" in your head off. It has a good score, good visual effects, some cool action scenes. The script has some issues and they make some bad decisions about who to kill off (plus fail at doing ""The Dark Phoenix saga"" justice according to comic fans). Having never read The Dark Phoenix saga I found the film completely passable and so did other friends I have who are filmfans, but not comic book readers. 

So I say watch all in release order except X-men Origins. Everything in Origins you need to know is covered in flashbacks in X2. And Origins is just painful to watch. Terrible mess of a script. Terrible visual effects. No memorable action scenes. A complete failure. ",,0,0,t3_34i8q4,

-The admantium was re-attached with zero official explanation as seen in DOFP

-The Jean Grey bits added very little to the experience of the character (for me, at least)

-DOFP retconned everything but the WWII portion, so the movie was made with the intent of being erased from continuity

Still the best Wolverine movie and the fourth best X-Film (after X2, DOFP, and First Class) IMO. The plot was good, better than several recent Marvel Studios movies.

Origins is just an inflated and unnecessary mess. Everything you needed to know about him was in the first 2 movies. 

X-3 had a couple of cool bits but ultimately suffered from underusing certain characters and killing off major ones quickly and almost carelessly and also doesn't matter because once again, DOFP. 

(We could argue that X-1 and 2 also don't matter, but I think they do simply for establishing Wolverine, Magneto, and Xavier before First Class, and it's neat that the franchise took the darkest path possible before turning itself around promisingly)

So if I were you, watch 1 and 2, The Wolverine, First Class, and DOFP in that order. You can pretend Jean never came back from the lake and that's why Wolverine is haunted by her.

Yes the newer X men movies retcon abit of the old movies but they dont entirely erase the older movies' story either and do a good job of finding a balance.

The Hollywood Reporter broke news of the project, bringing word that the new feature is being developed under the title Cubed. Newcomer Saman Kesh, best known for his recent short film ?ontroller,?will direct from a screenplay by Philip Gawthorne.

Written by Natali alongside Andr?Bijelic and Graeme Manson, the original Cube stars Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, David Hewlet, Andrew Miller, Julian Richings, Wayne Robson and Maurice Dean Wint as seven complete strangers who find themselves mysteriously trapped in a maze-like prison that forces them to navigate a series of deadly puzzles to hopefully gain their freedom and find out what has brought them together in the first place.

Cube was followed by both a sequel, Cube 2: Hypercube, in 2002, and a prequel, Cube Zero, in 2004.

&gt; Julian Michaels (Bruce Willis) has designed the ultimate resort\: VICE, where anything goes and the customers can play out their wildest fantasies with artificial inhabitants who look, think and feel like humans. When an artificial (Ambyr Childers) becomes self-aware and escapes, she finds herself caught in the crossfire between Julian's mercenaries and a cop (Thomas Jane) who is hell-bent on shutting down Vice, and stopping the violence once and for all.

It doesn't focus too much on the war itself, more the collapse of the German leadership leader up to and after a certain person's suicide (spoiler, I guess?).  Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler was phenomenal.  You might actually be somewhat familiar with the movie from the [Hitler / X-box parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkDxF2kn1I).  The great thing about this movie is it portrays Hitler and company as actual people instead of monstrous demons like certain other movies do.  Yes, the Nazis were twisted people that did terrible things, but they were still people, not some supernatural evil.  

There was also a pretty good television miniseries (they merged it together to make one film) called [Nuremberg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208629/) that would make a good wrap up of any movie marathon about the European theatre.  Alec Baldwin is in it.  I majored in History and I was the weird kid that didn't care about the battles and such but loved the politics and diplomacy of World War II, so the movies I tend to watch don't have quite so much fighting, but focus on the political bigwigs pulling the strings.  Nuremberg is (surprise) about the Nuremberg Trials so it follows the trial of the Nazi high command (unlike [Judgement at Nuremberg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055031/) which is based on the Judge's Trial).  A good movie that simplified the real life trial, so there is a factual mistake here and there- *goddammit, there is one part where they call Field Marshall Keitel an admiral and it pisses me off every time* -but nothing too egregious.

It's set in the weeks leading up to D-Day and portrays quite a different side of the war than most films. The main character is a self described coward with no interest in fighting whatsoever, and we see much more of the petty and competitive nature of the military rather than just gung-ho action. There's also much more frank discussion of sex on the home front, and the luxuries that the military higher-ups can afford in wartime Britain.

&gt; In the action-comedy The Interview, Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) run the popular celebrity tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they land an interview with him in an attempt to legitimize themselves as journalists. As Dave and Aaron prepare to travel to Pyongyang, their plans change when the CIA recruits them, perhaps the two least-qualified men imaginable, to assassinate Kim Jong-un.

**Critical reception:**
&gt; The Interview received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 52% approval rating, based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 5\.6\/10\. The site's consensus reads\: ""Unfortunately overshadowed by controversy (and under-screened as a result), The Interview's screenplay offers middling laughs bolstered by its two likable leads."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Upon its December 26, 1973, release, the film received mixed reviews from critics, ""ranging from 'classic' to 'claptrap'."" Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, ""This is the scariest film I've seen in years?he only scary film I've seen in years ... If you want to be shaken?nd I found out, while the picture was going, that that's what I wanted?hen The Exorcist will scare the?(shit) out of you."" Variety noted that it was ""an expert telling of a supernatural horror story ... The climactic sequences assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror."" In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it ""an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see ... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before."" Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects but at the end of the review wrote, ""I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won? be one, because what we get here aren? the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?""
